A 10-month-old developmentally normal boy, second born of third degree consanguineous parents, presented with right focal seizures. Postictally, the child had altered sensorium along with right hemiparesis. He was hospitalized for the same and was later referred to us on day 6 of illness.\nAt admission, the child was in altered sensorium with a Glasgow coma score (pediatric) of 12. He had significant pallor but was hemodynamically stable. All peripheral pulses were well- palpable. Clinical diagnosis of left middle cerebral artery territory AIS was kept and MRI brain confirmed the same []. MR angiography revealed a sudden cut-off in left internal carotid artery just after the origin with complete occlusion of the same but dissection could not be ruled out. Intracranial left internal carotid artery and its branches were also not visualized and there were no significant collaterals []. On sonography and Doppler of neck vessels, left internal carotid artery could not be visualized. Echocardiography was essentially normal.\nThe child was extensively evaluated for all possible risk factors contributing to stroke, detailed in . His blood investigations revealed a normocytic normochromic anemia (MCV = 94 Î¼l) with a normal platelet and total leucocyte count. By the fourth day of hospitalization, he developed thrombocytopenia with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Peripheral smear examination showed schistocytes (4%-5%) with a low reticulocyte count. His serum vitamin B12, folate, plasma homocysteine, and C3 levels were within normal limits. Subsequently, a gradual decline of hemoglobin levels and platelet count was noted. In addition to the evolution of bicytopenia, he also developed facial puffiness with hypertension. A working diagnosis of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was considered and clinical exome sequencing was ordered. He was started on daily fresh frozen plasma transfusion followed by Plasma Exchange (PEX). Once platelet counts improved to >1 lac/mm3 with normalization of blood pressure records, the child was switched to oral steroids which were continued for about a month and gradually tapered monitoring the platelet count.\nExome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous nonsense variation in exon 2 of the SLC19A2 gene (chr1:169446604; G>C; Depth: 119x) that results in a stop codon and premature truncation of the protein at codon 199 (p. Ser199Ter; ENST00000236137). The region is conserved across species. The detected variant was predicted to be damaging by SIFT, LRT and Mutation Taster and was likely pathogenic.\nAt 3-month follow-up, the child developed sensorineural hearing loss. Bone marrow aspirate revealed cellular marrow with adequate megakaryocytosis and erythroid series showed megaloblastic maturation. HbA1c was 6.7 g/dl (normal < 6.5%). Child was initiated on thiamine in supratherapeutic doses (500 mg/day). Currently, at 2-year follow-up, hematological parameters are within normal limits. There has not been any recurrence of stroke. He failed a hearing-aid trial and has been planned for cochlear implant surgery. Informed consent was obtained from parents for publication.\nThiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia (Roger syndrome) is characterized by a clinical triad of megaloblastic anemia, deafness, and diabetes. Megaloblastic anemia and diabetes may manifest from infancy to adolescence while deafness usually manifests in the toddler age group. This entity was first described in 1969 by Roger et al.[] It is caused by a mutation in SLC19A2 gene, which encodes the high-affinity thiamine transporter. Besides classical triad, other features include abnormalities of retina and optic nerve, stroke-like episodes, congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, aminoaciduria, tri-lineage myelodysplasia, short stature, and situs inversus.\nThiamine deficiency is known to affect respiratory chain complex I activity. The neurological features of TRMA, resembling those of mitochondrial complex I deficiency, may be caused due to a secondary defect in mitochondrial energy production.[] But, the association with stroke and pathophysiology of stroke in TRMA is unclear.\nTill date, there are two patients with TRMA reported with AIS and one with cerebral sinus thrombosis.[] Possible pathogenic mechanisms include: Mapping of human coagulation factor V and antithrombin III precursor to nearby region as SLC19A2 gene (a complex mutational event in this region may also involve coagulation cascade genes, causing susceptibility to thrombosis)[] and prothrombotic tendency due to hyperglycemic state (increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and the decreased endogenous fibrinolysis activity).[] Besides these, the clinical spectrum of TRMA is still evolving due to the rarity of this disorder; microvascular and coagulation pathway affection are still ambiguous. Also, the role of a particular genotype causing disease and stroke as a presenting feature is also unclear.\nOur initial clinical possibility in the index patient was congenital HUS/TTP in view of thrombocytopenia, hypertension, consanguinity and early infantile onset, and exome sequencing was done suspecting the same. But it revealed a likely pathogenic variation in the gene for TRMA. Anecdotal reports suggest that TRMA may be associated with stroke however its association with TTP/HUS is speculative. There have been rare reports of atypical HUS associated with cobalamin C defect which presents with megaloblastic anemia, methylmalonic acidemia, and homocystinuria.[] However, no direct link between TRMA and HUS/TTP have been mentioned. Both acquired HUS and TRMA seem to have coexisted in the index case and this probable unusual association merits documentation.\nThe basis for responsiveness of thrombocytopenia to plasma exchange in the index case is uncertain. Possibilities include superadded consumption coagulopathy, acquired hemolytic uremic syndrome/TTP, thiamine repletion, and prothrombotic state due to disease per se which also might have responded to plasma exchange.\nThis patient had two uncommon manifestations of this rare disorder: AIS and thrombocytopenia. Also, the child had a novel nonsense mutation in SLC19A2 gene. History of consanguinity, in this case, was another pointer towards a genetic disorder. Later, clinical features such as sensorineural hearing loss and slightly elevated HbA1c confirmed the clinical phenotype.\nThis case brings forth association between TRMA, prothrombotic state, and AIS; although the exact physiological basis still remains indeterminate. TRMA as a possible risk factor for stroke still remains a mystery. Evolving phenotypic spectrum of this disease might make the intricate pathways more lucid.\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms. In the form the patient(s) has/have given his/her/their consent for his/her/their images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal. The patients understand that their names and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal their identity, but anonymity cannot be guaranteed.\nNil.\nThere are no conflicts of interest.

A 46-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a painless mass in the left neck region, which had suddenly appeared on the same day without any previous cervical trauma. On physical examination, there was a soft, non-tender, non-pulsatile, and fluctuant swelling mass in the left neck region (). The mass was well-circumscribed and approximately 2.5 cm in diameter. The lesion was significantly enlarged with Valsalva maneuver and became prominent when the patient's neck was flexed. The skin overlying the swelling had no signs of inflammation, erythema or thickening. No other palpable masses or enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the rest of the neck. The patient had no underlying disease and no past history of deep venous thrombosis, local trauma or venous catheterization. A computed tomography angiography revealed a 1.6Ã2.1 cm sized venous aneurysm with intraluminal thrombus (). The aneurysm was derived from the left external jugular vein. The right external jugular vein and bilateral internal jugular veins were normal.\nLow molecular weight heparin was injected subcutaneously for 5 days, and surgical treatment was planned to prevent recurrent thrombosis and thromboembolism to the innominate vein and pulmonary arteries. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia in the supine position. An oblique incision on the left neck was made along the skin crease. A dilated vascular lesion arising from the external jugular vein was identified. The lesion was dissected freely and appeared as a dilated fusiform aneurysm of the vein itself (). The proximal and distal ends of the aneurysm were clearly demarcated and ligated, and subsequently, the aneurysm was completely excised. It was not necessary to reestablish venous continuity of the left external jugular vein. The patient was discharged 2 days after the surgery without any complications. In the follow up period the patient had no other local or general events. Pathologic report after the operation described a decrease in fibrous connective tissue and elastic fibers.

Physical examination revealed a confused and lethargic elderly male. His vitals showed blood pressure 97/42, heart rate of 51, respiratory rate of 12 and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. There were extensive ecchymoses in different stages of healing on all 4 extremities and on the torso. Laboratory data were consistent with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. ECG upon presentation revealed sinus rhythm with no abnormalities [].\nThe patient was rehydrated with intravenous normal saline and nephrotoxic medications were withheld. His renal function improved and on the 2nd day, his chest X-ray revealed patchy bilateral infiltrates. On the 3rd day, he developed respiratory distress with an increase in oxygen requirements.

After failing a trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, he was intubated and mechanically ventilated for hypoxic respiratory failure. He developed intermittent supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation were treated with intravenous esmolol and diltiazem after which he converted to sinus rhythm. On the 4th hospital day, he developed increasing oxygen requirements and asynchronous volume control ventilation; his ventilator settings were switched to pressure control ventilation. An echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 45-50% with grade II diastolic dysfunction and no wall motion abnormalities. Patient developed fever and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. He later became progressively hypoxic and tachypneic on the ventilator during the next couple of days. He was paralyzed using vecuronium. His clinical status worsened and his ventilator settings were changed; the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased to 13 mm Hg. ECG at the time showed ST segment and T wave changes concerning for ST elevation MI. Careful review of the ECG revealed bizarre, broad-based apparent ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads where the upward shift of the baseline started slightly before the onset of the QRS complexes. A more obvious dome and spike pattern was seen in the inferior leads []. These findings are not consistent with true ST-elevation MI. His central venous pressure decreased from 12 to 7 mm Hg and tidal volumes were increased from 550 to 750 cc during this period. An urgent bedside echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormalities. The ventilator settings were changed and the PEEP was discontinued.

One year later, there was no tumor recurrence or neck metastasis.\nHistological examination revealed that the resected tumor, which was 26 Ã 24 Ã 12 mm, was whitish in color and solid in consistency. The round cells were solid or arranged in cords, trabeculae, or nests, with hyalinized stroma with high vascularization. The tumor cells had eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei were round and varied in size, and the rough chromatin and mitotic count was less than 1/10 HPF. There was no necrosis (). The tumor had partly infiltrated the sublingual gland and had no clear boundary. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor was CD56 (+), chromogranin A (+), and synaptophysin (â) (). The Ki-67 index was 2.8%. A pathological diagnosis of typical carcinoid of the sublingual gland was made based on the morphological and immunological exam. The surgical margin was free, and no lymph node metastasis was found.

A 44-years-old male patient, teacher by profession, attended the neurosurgery outpatient department with complaint of weakness in both upper and lower limbs for one day and neck pain radiating to shoulder for two days duration. He was nonsmoker and non-alcoholic and was not suffering from diabetes, tuberculosis, hypertension or any chronic illness before. No history of drug abuse or trauma was present. On clinical examination, his vitals were within normal limit. Higher functions and cranial nerve examination were normal. Motor examination revealed grade 3/5 power in left side limbs, grade 4/5 powers in right side limbs, weak bilateral hand grip, exaggerated tendon reflex on left side limbs, and bilateral extensor plantar reflex. Bowel and bladder function was normal. Sensory examination showed decrease pain sensation on the left side limbs and decrease touch sensation on the right side limbs. There were no skin and subcutaneous nodules or cafÃ© au let spot. Clinically cervical myelopathy was suspected and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cervical spine was advised. Contrast-enhanced MRI of cervical spine revealed a lobulated enhancing intradural extramedullary mass of size about 35 Ã 13 mm on right posterolateral aspect of spinal cord from C3 to C5 vertebral body levels showing intratumoral macroscopic hemorrhage []. Radiological diagnosis was nerve sheath tumor with intratumoral hematoma and necrosis. Patient was operated on emergency. Laminectomy from C3 to C4 was done. After opening the dura, a chocolate colored lobulated mass was seen on posterolateral aspect of spinal cord. Under operating microscope, the arachnoid meter was cut open and the tumors bulged out. Intratumoral clots are removed. The mass was excised along with its capsule []. Wound was closed in layers. Post operative period was uneventful. His motor and sensory functions were normal on third post operative day. Histopathological examination of the excised mass confirmed schwannoma with intratumoral macroscopic hemorrhage [Figure â]. The patient was asymptomatic on follow-up.
