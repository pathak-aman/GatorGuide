A 62-year-old man with a 45-day history of generalized pruritus since February 2017 presented to the medical department. He had been diagnosed in another hospital with senile pruritus and had been treated by antihistamines and emollient cream for 20 days. The itch was not completely relieved, and he came to seek further treatment. He did not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. He had no notable medical history except for hypertension. On physical examination, there were no notable findings except for slight scratch marks. Blood tests showed normal erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet counts, and urinalysis and chest radiography showed nothing of note. There was no evidence of renal or thyroid dysfunction. Laboratory studies revealed normal liver chemistry. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 35 mm/h. A color duplex sonography of the abdomen revealed a large hypervascular, low-level echo, heterogeneous right renal mass. An intravenous pyelogram revealed irregularity of the margin of the right renal calices. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and the pelvis showed a heterogeneous mass originating from the upper pole of the right kidney and infiltrating to renal calices (Fig. a). Helical CT angiography (CTA) demonstrated a right renal tumor with a tumor thrombus in the right renal vein that did not extend into the inferior vena cava (IVC) (Fig. b). Further evaluation, including a bone scan, did not demonstrate any evidence of metastases.\nA right radical nephrectomy with a complete regional intraperitoneal lymphadenectomy with an anterior subcostal incision was performed in April 2017. No intraoperative or postoperative complications developed.\nGross examination showed a 9 × 8 × 8 cm daffodil yellow and madder red tumor with foci of necrosis. No positive surgical margins were discovered. There was a 2 cm yellowish-red soft tumor thrombus in the right renal vein without infiltration into the vessel wall. The tumor thrombus did not extend into the IVC but did infiltrate into the renal calices. No lymph node metastases were found. We obtained 12 random specimens from the tumor for histopathologic examination except for the tumor thrombus. Microscopy revealed that the mass consisted of nests and cords of cells separated by fine, arborizing fibrovascular septa. The collagenous material intermingled among tumor cells, which were cuboidal or polygonal in shape. The nuclei were optically clear with fine chromatin and round to oval in shape, lacked prominent nucleoli, and exhibited infrequent mitosis (Fig. ). There was necrosis in the tumor (Fig. a). Figure b shows microtumor thrombi in small vessels of the tumor. The histopathologic characteristics of the tumor thrombus in the renal vein were the same as those of the tumor in the kidney (Fig. c). Silver staining clearly demonstrated reticular fibers often outlining individual tumor cells (Fig. d), suggesting that the tumor was a sarcoma but not a carcinoma. Immunostaining was performed to make an exact histopathologic diagnosis. With immunostaining, tumor cells were positive for expressed vimentin, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM, CD56), and Ki-67 and focally positive for p53, Bcl-2 and CD10 (Fig. ). Immunostaining for alpha B-crystallin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, CAM5.2, CD34, chromogranin (Chr), Cytokeratin7, M2A oncofetal antigen (D2–40), Desmin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), hemopoietic cell kinase (HCK), neuron specific enolase (NSE), P63, renal cell carcinoma marker (RCC-Ma), S100, Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), CD57 and CD15 were negative. We carefully checked an internal positive control for the negative staining. We found a prominent vascular network with positive reactivity for CD34 in the tumor (Fig. a). RCC-Ma was positive in the luminal surface of Bowman's capsule adjoining the tumor (Fig. b, black arrow). EMA and CAM5.2 were expressed in renal tubules adjoining the tumor (Fig. c, d, black arrow). These data showed that the histopathologic diagnosis of the mass was CCSK. The pathological diagnosis was made by consultation of three pathologists in our hospital. The finalized pathologic stage was T3aN0M0 based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) definition and accepted as stage II according to the updated National Wilms Tumor Study 5 (NWTS-5) definition.\nTwo weeks after the operation, the generalized pruritus ended. One month after the operation, the patient started treatment with a regimen combining doxorubicin (DOX), vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Twenty months after the operation, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of local recurrence in the right kidney. Other examinations revealed no evidence of distant metastases. The patient is still alive and without clinical evidence of progression. The patient can complete daily life activities, occasionally feeling tired and experiencing numbness at the incision site.

Discharge: The patient was discharged for Uneventful postoperative recovery. A referral was made to Planned outpatient breast clinic follow-up. Patient discharged home three days after surgery","[Start Full note:]
A 42-year-old lady presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and disturbed vision. She also complained of a three-week history of bilateral breast swelling and right-sided breast pain. On examination, she was apyrexial and had a pulse rate of 76 beats per minute. Both breasts were dense with no discrete palpable lumps; however, she was also noted to have enlarged left axillary lymph nodes. Her abdomen was very tender in the right lower quadrant. White cell count and C-reactive protein were within normal limits.\nA contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis found increased attenuation with mild thickening of the appendix and a small amount of free fluid in the right paracolic gutter; an enlarged lymph node was also seen in the right iliac fossa (). A clinical diagnosis of appendicitis was made and the patient underwent an open appendicectomy. During the procedure, a morphologically inflamed appendix was found with abnormal thickening at the base; adjacent small bowel loops were also found to be adherent to the base. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged home three days later with a planned outpatient breast clinic follow-up. Imaging of the left breast (mammograms and ultrasound scan) showed an ill-defined spiculate mass measuring 30 mm by 27 mm () and enlarged left axillary lymph nodes. Core biopsies of the breast mass and fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of the pathological nodes were performed.\nHistology of the appendix showed extensive infiltration of the wall by a tumour which was present in sheets of cells sometimes showing an ""Indian filing"" pattern. The tumour infiltration also involved the lumen, mesoappendix, and peritoneum. Areas of angiolymphatic invasion were also present (). These features were consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast origin showing lobular differentiation. The breast core biopsies showed a grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma with some lobular differentiation () and low grade ductal carcinoma in situ. The FNA of the left axillary lymph node confirmed the presence of metastatic carcinoma. Both tumours were CK7 positive, CK20 and CDX2 negative (the latter precluding a gastrointestinal origin). The tumours were also positive for GCDFP15 (which is consistent with a breast primary), ER positive (7/8), PR positive (8/8), and HER2 negative. Based on the immunohistochemistry results, a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer was made.\nDuring the postoperative recovery period the patient noted a worsening of diplopia and left-sided headache. A head CT and contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbits were therefore performed. The MRI scan showed a left retroorbital, intraconal soft tissue mass between the medial and inferior recti muscles, suggestive of a metastatic deposit (: MRI orbits). No other significant brain lesions were noted.\nThe patient completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy (FEC: fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide), each at 3-weekly interval, and was then started on tamoxifen 20 mg daily. Staging scans (CT and MRI) performed after the chemotherapy and endocrine therapy showed a partial response in all the tumour sites, with reduction of the size of the left breast mass, the axillary, peritoneal, and mesenteric nodes. The orbital metastasis had also reduced in size and the patient noticed an improvement in her vision. Repeat whole body staging CT scan 9 months later showed further marginal reduction of the previously noted left orbital mass and no overt intra-abdominal pathology. Given the noticeable improvement in her condition, she currently remains under close clinical follow-up with the oncology team.

A 69-year-old male patient with decreased mental status and headaches after falling down the stairs visited our emergency room on around February 2010. His muscle strength was relatively preserved over a good grade on his all extremities. On the computer tomography of his brain, subdural hemorrhage on the right parietal lobe and the left frontal lobe, subarachnoid hemorrhage on the bilateral temporal lobe, and fracture on the right parietal bone were found (). The diagnosis of TBI was confirmed. He was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery for a conservative treatment, and his mental status was gradually improved from stupor to alert. He started his rehabilitation therapy including proper evaluations from 2 weeks after the injury. On functional evaluation, he could not sit alone nor stand without assist, and these disabilities could not be ruled out from poor corporations or decreased muscle strength. Three weeks after injury, he was transferred to the rehabilitation department, and he started cognitive rehabilitation program. On 5 weeks after injury, his cognitive function was markedly improved, and his Korean Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE-K) score was 21. His functional level was improved accordingly, and Korean Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) score was improved from 2 to 81. On 6 weeks after injury, we could evaluate his muscle strength precisely, and all his extremities showed over the good grade on manual muscle test. He was able to walk independently, and was discharged.\nHe received the rehabilitation therapy as an outpatient until 8 weeks after injury, and then he was encouraged to exercise alone at home receiving only outpatient follow-up. However, during staying in his home without serial rehabilitation therapy, his personality took on aggressive and delusional characteristics. His cognitive impairment and aggressive behavior got worse, and he was admitted to the Department of Neuropsychiatry with diagnosis of the delusional disorders on 3 months after his first discharging from the hospital. At the time he was hospitalized again, no auditory or visual hallucination was found; however, he appeared to have anxiety, delusion, and aggressive behavior. The magnetic resonance image (MRI) of his brain showed no additional lesion than the chronic changes from hemorrhages on bilateral cerebral hemisphere of his previous TBI. Accordingly, with the diagnosis of delusional disorder which occurred after TBI, he was treated with 2 mg of risperidone per day. After starting this medication, his delusion, anxiety, and aggressive behavior gradually improved enough to cooperate with the therapists. Two weeks later, he was given 10 mg of donepezil per day for his mild cognitive impairment. After 6 weeks of admission in the Department of Neuropsychiatry, he was transferred to the Department of Rehabilitation for the proper rehabilitation therapy, because he showed problems in his gait. He could walk independently, but he showed no movements in his upper extremities and his step-width was narrow. Additionally, he had scooped posture, bradykinesia, tremor in both hands, and sleep disorder. He complained of difficulty in walking, and he could not start any movement promptly. He had difficulties in all activities of daily living, and K-MBI score was 56/100. These symptoms were characteristics of Parkinsonism, and we assumed that this parkinsonian features were related with the administration of risperidone and donepezil, which were started before the onset of his parkinsonian features. Therefore, dopamine transporter imaging with [18F]FP-CIT PET-CT was performed to distinguish his parkinsonian features from idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and normal dopamine transporter density was observed in bilateral caudate nucleus and putamen (). With this result, we could exclude idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and we diagnosed his parkinsonian features as drug-induced Parkinsonism caused by concurrent use of risperidone and donepezil. We discontinued both donepezil and risperidone, and the parkinsonian features gradually disappeared. He was discharged with much improved functions, and K-MBI score was 75.

We report a case of 1-year-old male child presented to the ophthalmology OPD with abnormal appearance of both eyes since birth. He was born by an uneventful, full term delivery of a nonconsanguineous couple. At the time of birth, he had slight protrusion of both the eyes with abnormal lids, and bleeding off and on. The eyes continued to protrude until 3 months of age; the condition remains static ever since. He also developed tonic-clonic seizures after 3 months of age which still continued but decreased in frequency, and the last episode was 2 days before the presentation. He also reported having increased head circumference at birth that has not progressed since then. At the time of presentation, the child has abnormally protruded eyes with coloboma of middle 1/3 of right upper lid, and medial 1/2 of left upper lid; an abnormal skin fold present below the malformed left lid. A skin tag was present at the outer canthus of right eye [ and ]. The conjunctiva on the right side appears slightly cystic, both the conjunctiva and cornea were keratinized because of exposure. No other ocular abnormality in the form of orbital cyst or microphthalmia was present. He had frontal bossing with depressed nasal bridge [] and also slight protrusion of tongue. There were focal patches of alopecia with dermal hypoplasia of scalp [Figure and ]. Hyperpigmented patches were seen on the right side of the chest, abdomen and back with a slight extension onto the nape and right arm []. Developmental milestones were evidently delayed. A thorough general and systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality except for decreased muscle strength. Baseline investigations were unremarkable, and an abdominal ultrasound showed a complex splenic cyst of 6 mm.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the head showed aplasia of cerebellar vermis with enlarged superior vermian cistern. There was subependymal grey matter heterotopia of the postero-inferior aspect of the atrium of right lateral ventricle [].

Cranial nerve examinations and eye movements in all directions were normal. He was using hypermetropic glasses. Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral megalocornea, trabeculodysgenesis, nebular corneal opacity, hypoplastic optic discs, and tortuosity of retinal venous vessels, findings that were suggestive of a congenital cataract and glaucoma (). Neurologic examination revealed mild unilateral weakness with hemiparetic gait, increased reflexes, and Babinski sign on the right. He was making good academic progress at school and communication with the social environment.\nHis whole blood and routine biochemistry analyses with serum creatine kinase levels (80 units/L) were normal. EEG examination revealed frequent and irregular pathologic high-voltage theta- and alpha-wave groups with multifocal sharp and spike discharges in the left hemisphere. Brain background activity was normal.\nBrain MRI of patient 1 showed diffuse periventricular leukoencephalopathy (PVL) with left ventricular enlargement, small porencephalic cysts, and thinning of the body part of the corpus callosum (). Brain MRI analysis was performed twice, at ages 3 and 9 years, and no differences were seen between the 2 MRI analyses. Brain MRI angiography analysis was normal at age 9 years.\nHis epileptic seizures were consistent with complex partial seizures evolving to generalized seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy 1989 classification. Appropriate oral oxcarbazepine was introduced instead of sodium valproate. After the treatment, no seizures were observed during the 6-year follow-up of the patient.\nIn the following years, further diagnostic tests (serum levels of homocysteine, B12 vitamin, folic acid, lactate, pyruvate, biotinidase, and analyses of serum quantitative amino acids, acylcarnitines by tandem mass spectrometry, urine organic acid, serum arylsulfatase enzyme, and mitochondrial DNA sequence) were normal. Cardiac examination, echocardiogram, ECG, urine microscopic examination, and renal ultrasound were normal. His blood pressure and respiratory function were normal.

A 40 -year-old male patient, nondiabetic, nonsmoker and normotensive was presented with the history of persistent pain along the dorsal surface of right foot, which was aggravated with the activities. Conservative management was tried for 8 months without much relief. Diagnosis of ATTS was made on clinical examination. Nerve Conduction velocity (NCV) showed decreased conduction in deep peroneal nerve and stress test was positive. Patient was planned for operation. Under spinal anesthesia, the body part was prepared and tourniquet inflated. Intraoperatively, thrombosed dorsalis pedis artery was found along with two adjacent collateral vessels (, , and ). Retinaculum was released and nerve was mobilized. No adherence with the surrounding structures was found. Tight compartment got released. Upon deflating the tourniquet blood flow in the collaterals was checked, which was adequate. Dorsal pulsation was felt too. No excision was done. Wound was closed and the patient was followed up in outpatient department. Over 9 months of follow up, no recurrence of any symptoms was noted.\nTarsal tunnel corresponds to the carpel tunnel in the limb counterpart. Tight compartments exert pressure over the nerves resulting in the compressive neuropathies. Tarsal tunnel syndrome as the name suggests relates to the tightening of the inferior extensor retinaculum of the foot. It causes compression over the deep peroneal nerve resulting in the spectrum of symptoms. Numerous factors have been described to cause this compression. Intrinsic factors mentioned in the literature are due to osteophytes, ganglionic cysts or lipomas. These factors cause compensatory forefoot valgus leading to subtalar supination and midtarsal inversion leading to the pressure over the nerve.\nDistally the nerve is vulnerable to injury due to lack of protective sheath. Extrinsic factors like tight shoe laces or the external trauma can cause injury to the nerve. Edema or fibrosis causes pressure over the nerve and neural ischemia. The relation of nerve with the tendons and the vascular structures is depicted in . The little space in the tunnel formed by the inferior extensor retinaculum and the close proximity of the structures make the nerve vulnerable to compressive neuropathy. In an already small space, any addition to the structure can cause pressure over the nearby structures. The final brunt is to be burnt by the nerve, as happened in our case.\nThe patient had trivial trauma at the ankle, which can cause thrombosis at the dorsalis pedis artery. Over time, the collaterals had developed to compensate for the dysfunctional arterial segment and to bypass it. Addition of new vessels in the already tight tunnel had resulted in the pressure over the nearby structures, including the nerve. The mixed sensorimotor nature of the deep peroneal nerve leads to both sensory and motor symptoms as in our case.

Our case was a 53-year-old man who received a deceased donor kidney transplant 16 years ago, which was presumably due to hypertension. He presented with redness, pain and swelling of his left arm. He reported no trauma but was trimming shrubs and plants one week earlier. He also complained of intermittent fever and chills. There was no significant animal contact or recent travels. He took cyclosporine and mycophenolate for immunosuppression but had no recent use of corticosteroids.\nEvaluation showed a temperature of 100.3 °F, heart rate of 99 beats/min, respiration of 20 cycles/min and blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg. Skin examination showed erythema, tenderness and swelling on the medial aspect of his left arm and forearm in a linear fashion (). There was also a wound on his left forearm, which was located distal to the sporotrichoid lesion, which he thought might have been due to an insect bite or an injury related to his recent gardening (). There was an old unused dialysis graft on the forearm, which appeared to be unaffected. There were no significant lymph node enlargement and the examination of the other systems was completely unremarkable.\nUltrasound imaging of the left arm showed hypoechoic, tubular type structures (the largest measuring 8 × 5 mm) in the subcutaneous fat, which is consistent with an abscess. Two views of the chest radiograph was normal.\nThe patient underwent incision and drainage of a long abscess tract, which measured approximately 35 cm. Frank purulent drainage was expressed from the tract and was sent for bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures. In the meantime, the patient was started on empirical intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin while awaiting culture results. Sporotrichosis was considered as a strong differential but antifungal therapy was deferred until the culture results became available.\nSignificant laboratory findings include a white blood cell count of 12.2 × 109/L, blood urea nitrogen of 56 mg/dL and creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.8 mg/dL. Blood cultures and culture of the distal left forearm wound were negative for any growth.\nPale, yellowish-white colonies were isolated from fungal cultures of the pus on Sabouraud dextrose agar without Chloramphenicol after 11 days ().\nThe gram stain of the colonies revealed aerobic, branching, gram positive rods, which were further identified by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing as Nocardia brasiliensis. Susceptibility results showed that the isolate was sensitive to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, amoxicillin/clavulanate, moxifloxacin, amikacin, ceftriaxone and tobramycin; had intermediate sensitivity to doxycycline and minocycline; and was resistant to imipenem, ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin. The bacterial cultures did not grow and were discarded after 5–7 days per institution protocol. Mycobacterial cultures were also negative. Pathology of the excised abscess tissue revealed acute inflammation and abscess formation, which involved the dermis and subcutaneous tissue with dermal and fat necrosis. No bacterial or fungal elements were seen on appropriate stains. Due to his worsening kidney function, a renal biopsy of his transplanted kidney was obtained, which showed findings that were consistent with IgA nephritis, chronic allograft nephropathy and glomerulosclerosis.\nHe received amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 twice daily for 6 months for definitive treatment of his Nocardia infection. Three weeks post discharge, the sporotrichoid lesion significantly improved and the abscess wounds showed evidence of good healing ().

The mother was a 40-year old woman in good physical condition reporting weekly physical activity such as running and muscle workout. It was her third pregnancy with two sons of 17 and 14 years old, living and free of any disease. She had a history of gestational diabetes during her second pregnancy that required insulin supplementation, but her blood sugar was well-controlled with diet and exercise for the third pregnancy. Her blood pressure and biochemistry revealed no sign of pre-eclampsia. She was referred for an ultrasound at 33 weeks to exclude foetal brain calcification because she had visited an endemic zone for Zika virus (i.e., Cuba) at 29 weeks of gestation. Blood testing for Zika at 32 weeks of gestation was negative. The father was a healthy 41-year old male with no prior children. Both parents were non-smokers and reported no familial history of genetic or neurodevelopmental disorders.\nNotably, the mother reported the feeling of frequent and intense hiccups in the fetus. More precisely, from approximately 26–27 weeks of gestation, episodes of several minutes of regularly-spaced brief spasms were experienced every day (generally one or two times per day). These episodes sometimes lasted up to 20 min and occasionally featured spasms of varied intensity.\nThe 33 week ultrasound performed in regular clinical setting revealed the presence of multiple cardiac tumors, indicative of rhabdomyomas and of potential TSC. The mother was then referred to CHU Ste-Justine (specialized pediatric hospital) for in depth clinical investigation. Cardiac ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging were then performed on the same day (i.e., 33 weeks and 4 days of gestation) to investigate for TSC in the fetus.\nCardiac ultrasound revealed the presence of at least 6 cardiac tumors in the fetus. One tumor was localized to the roof of the right atrium (Fig. a, left). It was a non-obstructive tumor of 3.04 cm circumference. At least two tumors were present in the left ventricle. The first was from the subaortic region to the apex and had a circumference of 6.26 cm (Fig. b, left). It appeared slightly obstructive of the subaortic region. The second was located posterior and at the apex, and had a circumference of 3.09 cm. At least three non-obstructive tumors were present in the right ventricle. The largest (5.37 cm circumference; Fig. b, right) was located in the middle, the second at the apex (3.11 cm circumference), and the third at mid-ventricular position near the septum (3.39 cm circumference). These observations are strongly indicative of multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas.\nThe left and right atriums were of normal size with the membrane of the oval foramen curving towards the left atrium. The left and right ventricles were also of normal size with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordances. The mitral and tricuspid valves appeared normal with normal flux. The cardiac rhythm was regular, with no sign of arrhythmia. The left and right pulmonary veins appeared normally connected to the left atrium, and caval veins to the right atrium. The umbilical vein was of normal size with normal implantation of ductus venosus. The aortic valve (5.4 mm) and pulmonary valve (6.5 mm) also appeared normal. The aortic arc and isthmus appeared of good size.\nBlood circulation was observed to be relatively normal. More precisely, normal flux was measured at the level of pulmonary veins and ductus venosus (S: 89 cm/s, A: 33 cm/s, pulsatility index [PI]: 0.78), at the level of mitral and tricuspid valves, as well as at the level of ascending aorta, pulmonary arteria, and arterial canal. There was a slight acceleration of the left ventricle-aorta axis (100 cm/s), likely resulting from the proximity of one of the largest tumors. Lastly, the resistance index of uterine arteries was normal (right: 0.45, left: 0.4, late systolic notch [LSN]: 0.59), and velocimetry was also normal for umbilical arteries both at the abdominal insertion (PI: 0.98, LSN: 1.3) and the placental insertion (PI: 1.13, LSN: 1.2).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed the same day as the cardiac ultrasound to screen for additional markers of TSC in the fetus, with a particular focus on the central nervous system. Multiple and well-defined subependymal nodules were observed at the surrounding of both the left and right lateral brain ventricles (Fig. a to c). In addition, regions of abnormal signal were detected in the white matter (Fig. a and c) and several hyper-intense regions indicative of cortical tubers were observed throughout the cerebral cortex (Fig. b and c). A hyper-intense region was also localized to the left cerebellum and the possibility of cysts to kidneys was also raised.\nTogether, observations from the cardiac ultrasound and the MRI confirmed the diagnosis of TSC in the fetus given the finding of two of the major criteria for the disease (i.e., cardiac rhabdomyomas and subependymal nodules). The definite TSC diagnosis was further supported by additional signs of TSC (e.g., hyper-intense cortical and cerebellar regions compatible with tubers). At this stage, medical pregnancy interruption was chosen by the parents. The interruption was executed at 34 weeks and 3 days of gestation together with an amniocentesis in order to perform genetic screening (see below). The parents also requested an autopsy of the fetus, of which the main findings are reported hereafter.\nThe definite diagnosis of TSC strongly suggested the presence of a genetic modification in one of the two genes commonly associated with the disease, namely TSC1 and TSC2 [, , ]. The TSC1 gene product is the protein hamartin and that of TSC2 is tuberin, both of which are involved in the protein synthesis pathway [, ]. In general, the disease symptomatology is more severe in patients with mutations in TSC2 compared to TSC1 [, , , ]. A sequencing analysis of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, including a search for duplication and deletion, was performed on the amniotic liquid sample by GeneDx (Gaithersburg, MD).\nGenetic screening revealed that the fetus carried one copy (heterozygous) of a duplication of an adenine (A) at position 5169 of the coding sequence of the TSC2 gene (TSC2 c.5169dupA; Fig. d). According to genomic sequence identification number NG_005895.1 (NCBI) and transcript identification number ENST00000219476.9 (), this duplication occurs in exon 41 of the TSC2 gene that contains 42 exons. The TSC2 c.5169dupA modification is predicted to cause a frameshift starting with the codon 1724 coding for a glutamine and resulting in a change of this amino acid into a threonine and in a premature stop codon at position 5 after the reading frame is mutated (therefore denoted p.Gln1724ThrfsX5). This duplication is thus expected to be associated with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and loss of function (or alternatively with abnormal protein function resulting from a mutated and truncated protein of 1727 amino acids instead of 1807 for the intact tuberin). Given that the c.5169dupA variant of TSC2 is not observed in large population cohorts [], it is considered a pathogenic variant. However, although it is recognized as being pathogenic in clinical setting, to our knowledge, no study to date has reported a causal relationship between TSC2 c.5169dupA and TSC. No other TSC1 and TSC2 gene variant was detected by sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis of the fetal sample.\nTo verify if the genetic variant was a de novo mutation, as is the case for over two-thirds of TSC cases [, ], the blood of both parents was screened for the specific mutation identified in the fetus. The parents showed an absence of detectable TSC2 c.5169dupA mutation in their blood sample. The presence of this specific mutation in the germline, specifically in paternal gametes, was further screened using DNA extraction, PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of a sperm sample of the father (with forward primer 5′-GTTCTGGCGTGACCACCAAGTC-3′, and reverse primer 5′- CAATCTGTGCAGGGGCTTTGCTA-3′). This last genetic test revealed an absence of c.5169dupA (Fig. e). Given that hypomelanotic macules in TSC manifest as white skin spots, genetic testing was also performed on a biopsy of a small white skin spot (3 mm2) of the mother, which also revealed an absence of the fetal mutation (Fig. f). The absence of the fetal mutation in the blood and tissues of the parents thus supports a de novo mutation.\nThe autopsy revealed a fetus of 2556.2 g (90th percentile for 34 weeks of gestation) and 50 cm (> 90th percentile), and of 34 cm cranio-caudal length (> 90th percentile). The head circumference was 30 cm, the thorax circumference 28 cm, and that of the abdomen 24 cm. In general, biometric measurements corresponded to normal values for a gestational age of 37 weeks. The fetus did not present signs of dysmorphic features (e.g., normal ears, neck, nasal and buccal cavities, normally developed limbs). In general, the internal position and configuration of organs also appeared normal. More precisely, the left lung presented two lobes and was 24 g; the right lung presented three lobes and was 30 g; lung tissue appeared visually normal; the digestive track also appeared normal, with the liver weight of 140 g and pancreas 2.4 g. Similarly, macroscopic evaluation of the kidney, bladder and ureters revealed no abnormal position or configuration (left kidney: 14.3 g, right kidney: 14.1 g, left adrenal gland 4.5 g, right adrenal gland: 5.1 g). The same applied for the thymus, thyroid, spleen, as well as male genital organs. The results of the cardiac ultrasound were confirmed by the observation of multiple tumors in the heart.\nThe brain weight post-fixation (formalin zinc) was 380 g. The fronto-occipital diameters were about 12.1 cm. Brain biometric measurements were corresponding to a gestational age of 37–38 weeks and were higher than the 95th percentile for a 34-week fetus. The examination of the surface of cerebral hemispheres revealed the normal presence of all primary sulci. However, some gyri appeared to have a pachygyric aspect, with a firm consistency upon touch suggesting the presence of cortical tubers (Fig. a). These firm areas were noted to be predominant in the left hemisphere, particularly in the left frontal lobe. The external morphology of the spinal cord appeared normal.\nThe examination of coronal slices of cerebral hemispheres revealed areas of firmer consistency in the white matter and at the hemispheric surface. Microscopic examination exposed the presence of diffuse lesions of the white matter composed of globular astrocytes and organized in track alongside the axis of vessels. These lesions were associated with typical ""balloon cells"" and were abundant and extended, appearing in almost all cerebral lobes and sometimes almost occupying an entire gyrus. When they involved the cerebral cortex, they were responsible for a disorganization of the cortical cytoarchitecture (Fig. b). Small and numerous cortical lesions (tubers) were observed at the surface of the cortex, sometimes isolated but most often in continuity with white matter lesions described above (Fig. a and b). These were characterized by large abnormal astrocytic cells and round ""balloon cells"" (Fig. c). Astrocytes of white matter lesions and tubers strongly expressed the protein GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), which was not the case for nearby balloon cells. These lesions were also accompanied with microglial activation (sometimes particularly marked). Brain ventricles did not appear to be enlarged but numerous bilateral subependymal nodules were observed in lateral ventricles (Fig. d). Nodules were found in the germinal zone, near the sulcus terminalis, in anterior, near the head of the caudate nucleus (Fig. e), and in posterior, close to the thalamus. They were made up of large astrocytes with elongated cytoplasm (Fig. f), showing a weak GFAP staining. The examination of axial slices of the mesencephalon showed a very narrow aqueduct of Sylvius. One small lesion, suggestive of a tuber, was also found in the cerebellum, of which the parenchyma was intensely congested. No calcification was observed at this prenatal/precocious stage. The multiplicity and extent of cortical lesions and subependymal nodules observed in the fetus supported a particularly severe form of TSC.

A man in his 60s with prostate cancer metastatic to bone and end-stage renal disease was brought to the hospital by his wife due to several days of reduced appetite and inability to ambulate independently. He had a history of strokes suffered 2 years ago and 10 months ago, with residual aphasia. Five months ago, he was admitted for sepsis associated with his tunneled dialysis catheter, with catheter tip and blood cultures having grown Enterobacter cloacae.\nOn presentation, he was febrile to 104°F, normotensive, had a heart rate of 134 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 95%. He possessed a right chest dialysis catheter tunneled to the right internal jugular vein, and a left chest subcutaneous chemotherapy port entering the left subclavian vein. Neurologic examination confirmed expressive aphasia. Antibiotics were started, and he was admitted to the hospital for probable catheter-associated sepsis.\nAfter the patient's arrival at the medical floor, an intern embarked to obtain differential blood cultures. A large-bore needle was inserted into the chemotherapy port and gentle negative pressure was applied to the syringe, with no return of blood. The attempt was aborted and the intern moved to the right side to inspect the dialysis catheter; however, the patient was found to have lost consciousness. Vital signs were normal, and examination revealed torticollis and gaze deviation to the right; a stroke code was promptly called. After evaluation by the neurologist, the patient was transported for head computed tomography (CT). Approximately 20 minutes later, the patient regained consciousness while on the CT table. The scan showed no acute changes. Ultimately, the event was suspicious more for complex seizure than stroke; therefore, thrombolytic treatment was not given. Nonetheless, follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed new ischemia in the right and left frontal lobes (). Neurological examination progressed to prominent right-sided weakness, which was not present on admission.\nBlood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. To prevent recurrent bacteremia, the tunneled dialysis catheter was removed at bedside on hospital day 2, and the patient was booked for removal of the chemotherapy port under general anesthesia. He recovered readily from sepsis.\nA chart review was conducted. The chemotherapy port had been implanted several years ago and was no longer in use. During the patient's admission for stroke 10 months ago, contrast echocardiography had revealed a right-to-left shunt, with contrast appearing in the left atrium 2 to 3 beats prior to the right atrium. No atrial septal defect was seen on transesophageal echocardiogram. The technologist noted that the shunt was visible with contrast injected into the left arm, but not the right. This finding was followed-up with a CT venogram of the chest, which failed to identify the source of shunt. At this point, the diagnostic inquiry ended. We sought a radiologist's review of the CT scan and ascertained that it was nondiagnostic due to incorrect contrast phasing; therefore, we repeated the scan under a pulmonary embolism protocol. This CT angiogram showed left brachiocephalic vein stenosis related to the catheter tip, partial superior vena cava thrombus, and extensive venous collateralization via intercostal, mediastinal, and azygos veins (). There was increased density in the left superior pulmonary vein () suggestive of SPVS. Coronal images revealed filling of the left bronchial venous plexus (), which drains into the pulmonary veins. Interventional radiology was consulted to perform a traditional venogram ().\nA risk-benefit analysis was performed, weighing the risk of removing the chemotherapy port to prevent further bacteremia against keeping the port due to the possibility of precipitating further emboli during port extraction. After discussion with the surgery service, it was decided to forgo removal of the port. The patient was bridged with heparin to long-term warfarin therapy. He was referred to the infectious disease clinic for close monitoring, and discharged to subacute rehabilitation.

The only comorbidity was a mental illness.\nAn ultrasound (US) of the neck was immediately performed and revealed a multinodular retrosternal goiter, for which the larger nodule in the right lobe presented with a diameter of approximately 6 cm and complete ring calcification. The goiter extended into the upper mediastinum and was lying on the aortic arch.\nDue to the goiter's retrosternal configuration, we performed a CT scan of the neck and thorax. The scan showed the posterior dislocation of the epiaortic vessels and lateral dislocation and compression of the pharynx. The large nodule described previously based on US exhibited a mixed type of calcification; in fact, in the context of a large egg-shell calcification, multiple spots with microcalcifications were observed (A and B).\nGiven the notable dimensions of the goiter, its symptomatic disposition and the extreme calcification of the nodule, we chose to avoid an ultrasound-guided ago-biopsy due to the low probability of obtaining a good tissue sample and the consequent diagnosis, and in agreement with the patient's endocrinologist, we decided to directly perform a standard thyroidectomy through a cervicotomy. The primary difficulty during the operation was the complete calcification of the entire right lobe, which was adherent to the trachea and vascular structures (A and B). However, no major bleeding or complications occurred during surgery.\nMacroscopically, the pathologist described a nodule with a weight of 130 g that was partially cavitated and extremely hard when cut (A and B).\nA microscopic histological examination excluded the presence of atypical cells and revealed nodular hyperplasia in fibrotic areas.\nThe patient's postoperative course did not involve any complications related to the surgical procedure, and she was discharged two days after the surgery.

Our first case was an 82-year-old man with multiple medical comorbidities including severe dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type II diabetes, who presented with an enlarging, exophytic mass extending from his lip. He was a former 50 pack year smoker with a long history of daily chewing tobacco use. The lesion presented 6 months prior and homeopathic remedies were attempted prior to presenting to the clinic. On exam, he had a fungating lesion over 40 mm in size involving the central lower lip, sparing the bilateral commissures. The mass extended from the buccal mucosa with no obvious bony involvement. A computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck demonstrated a 37 mm exophytic mass, arising from the midline and left paramedian inner, lower lip with no underlying bony involvement. Biopsy of the mass was positive for ulcerated, invasive, well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. It was not tested for HPV. He was staged as T2N0M0 (stage III). He was initially evaluated for a surgical resection and reconstruction expected to last 12 h, but given the high perioperative risks involved, he was determined not to be a surgical candidate. He was therefore referred to radiation oncology for treatment.\nRadiation treatment options were discussed, including intensity modulated radiation treatment (IMRT) given over 6–7 weeks covering his primary and draining lymphatics, versus localized SBRT in five treatments. The patient and his family opted to proceed with SBRT and he received 3000 cGy in five twice-weekly treatments (600 cGy per treatment), with concurrent cetuximab (a loading dose of 400 mg/m2 preceding SBRT followed by six weekly infusions of 250 mg/m2). The treatment field included the lower lip and buccal mucosa (Figure ). During treatment, he had noticeable clinical response (Figures A,B). He tolerated treatment well with the only adverse effects being grade 2 dermatitis at the treatment site and grade 1 fatigue. He was seen at 2 months follow-up and had a marked improvement in tumor volume and complete resolution of the treatment-related skin erythema (Figure C). He had no oral functional deficits after radiation treatment and was satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes. At the time of manuscript submission, he was 12 months out from treatment with continued response and no evidence of toxicity.

A 25-year-old male patient, a known case of extrahepatic portal venous obstruction and portal hypertension, was detected to have nephrotic syndrome during his pre-anesthetic evaluation for hydrocele surgery. He was told that his surgery was deferred till his kidney disease was evaluated and treated. It was felt that the worsening ascites and subsequent scrotal swelling was aggravated by the presence of his nephrotic state, and hence correction of his nephrotic state will reduce post-operative complications and recurrence of his scrotal swelling. He was subsequently referred to our hospital for his renal evaluation and management.\nAt the age of 12 years, he had an episode of hematemesis and was evaluated and found to have esophageal varices. Evaluation of his portal hypertension revealed the presence of extrahepatic portal venous obstruction. He was managed with oral propranolol. He stayed asymptomatic except for minimal ascites. His liver functions on regular follow-up stayed normal.\nThree months prior to this admission, he started developing scrotal swelling, abdominal distension and pedal edema for which he consulted a surgeon. Physical examination revealed pallor, pedal oedema, tense ascites, splenomegaly and bilateral hydrocele. Laboratory investigations showed evidence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency hypoalbuminemia, and normal liver enzymes. His coagulation work up was normal. His cardiac evaluation did not reveal any abnormality. His urine analysis revealed the presence of proteinuria. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed massive splenomegaly, ascites and no evidence of liver cirrhosis. Liver biopsy showed normal liver architecture with no abnormality. Adiagnosis of nephrotic syndrome was made and the bilateral hydrocele repair was postponed, and the patient was referred to the Nephrology services of our hospital for the management of nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency.\nThe laboratory investigations in our hospital are shown in .\nA renal biopsy was advised for histopathological diagnosis. However, due to pancytopenia and tense ascitis, a percutaneous renal biopsy was deferred and open renal biopsy was considered. An open surgical biopsy was also considered risky as the anatomical position of his kidneys necessitated 12th rib resection for renal access. The case was discussed with the interventional radiologists whose opinion was sought for management of hypersplenism. It was felt that during his partial splenic embolisation via the transjugular route, a renal biopsy can be performed. Transjugular renal biopsy along with splenic embolization was thus advised and after optimisation with blood and blood products the patient underwent both the procedures in the same sitting. For the transjugular renal biopsy, 8 Fr guiding sheath was guided into the lower pole of right (R) renal vein. The long transjugular liver biopsy needle (Cook USA) was used to get a core biopsy. The needle tip was protected with a 5 Fr catheter. Under fluoroscopic control, the needle was positioned deep in the vein, allowing the tip to protrude into the renal cortex []. No post procedure complications like drop in hematocrit, gross hematuria or perirenal hematoma were encountered.\nPost procedure his platelet counts improved to 120,000/μL (vs. 77,000) and WBC count to 16,300, three days after the splenic embolization. However, the biopsy specimen was inadequate for an opinion and a re-biopsy through the transjugular approach was done with no complications []. Biopsy was suggestive of minimal change disease. He was started on oral steroids. His condition gradually improved with resolution of pallor and pedal edema and ascites. Pre-steroid urine protein/creatinine ratio was 11.67 which improved to 3.02 after 1week of steroids and ACE inhibitors. His haemoglobin and albumin levels improved subsequently. He underwent bilateral hydocele repair successfully with no complications. Predischarge he received his pneumococcal vaccination. He is now asymptomatic and under regular follow-up. At 6-months post follow-up, he was in clinical and biochemical remission for his nephrotic syndrome and had normal renal functions.

A 25-year-old nulliparous woman presented with 24 h of increasing left lower quadrant pain, worsened with movement and temporarily relieved with narcotic medications given by the emergency room provider. She had a past medical history of PCOS and a surgical history of a right salpingectomy secondary to a right paraovarian cyst resulting in an isolated necrotic torsed fallopian tube at 13 years of age.\nPhysical exam revealed an obese female with normal vital signs. Abdominal exam was significant for left lower quadrant pain on deep palpation, with no rebound or guarding present. Bimanual examination revealed similar pain at left adnexa but otherwise benign with no vaginal bleeding, cervical motion tenderness or otherwise palpable masses. Of note, the physical examination was performed after patient had already received 975 mg of acetaminophen, 600 mg of ibuprofen and three doses of 2 mg morphine by emergency room providers.\nLaboratory evaluation was significant only for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.85 × 109/l with an otherwise normal complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile and urinalysis. Transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound revealed a simple left adnexal cyst 1.5 × 1.2 × 1.4 cm and a 4 × 3.8 × 4.1 cm mildly complex cyst, both of which appeared to be extraovarian. Arterial and venous waveforms were documented for both ovaries. Fluid in the endocervical canal was also noted.\nThe patient's surgical history was significant for a similar presentation to the emergency department at 13 years of age. Upon review of the medical record that was available, a nurse at triage noted the patient was complaining of right lower quadrant pain that worsened over the day and stated that the patient was ""doubled over in triage"". Unfortunately, no provider note could be found regarding physical examination and history of presenting illness. A CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis had revealed a 5.1 × 4.4 cm right ovarian cyst with trace amount of surrounding fluid (). Otherwise, the left adnexa and uterus were normal. Review of the operative note for the procedure in 2008 revealed a 6x6cm right adnexal structure that appeared to be torsed, blue and hemorrhagic and included a dilated right tube. A salpingectomy was then performed without complication. The right ovary, left ovary and tube at that time were noted to be grossly normal.\nThe decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for a diagnostic laparoscopy as there was enough clinical suspicion for either an ovarian, adnexal or tubal torsion based on the physical exam, ultrasound finding of extraovarian cysts and the patient's significant surgical history. Laparoscopically, a left-sided 4 cm paratubal cyst was removed and a left fallopian tube without signs of necrosis was de-torsed four times in a clockwise fashion (). The ovaries bilaterally were grossly normal. Surgical pathology two weeks later revealed a simple paratubal cyst. No frozen specimen was sent intraoperatively as malignancy was of low concern.
