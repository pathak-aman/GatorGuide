A 52-year-old man with a medical history of high blood pressure and gout was referred to our department for oral mucosa burning causing him pain and discomfort. He was an ancient smoker and reported the sensation of headache with notorious dizziness on two occasions recently. The extraoral examination showed slight facial erythrosis (). Intraoral examination showed slightly hyperkeratotic erythematous lesions located on the inner side of the labial mucosa (). They were pruriginous and painful causing the symptomatology of the patient. The inner sides of the cheeks showed erythematous erosions especially on the right side (). We noticed also two erosive ulcerations as well as hyperkeratotic lesions at the right lateral edge and the ventral side of the tongue forming a discrete reticular network ().\nIn front of these signs, we suspected oral lichen planus associated with candidiasis infection. Mycological examination confirmed candidiasis, and initial treatment consisted of topical mouthwashes with Amphotericin B (50 mg; 5 ml 3 times per day) and Chlorhexidine (0.12%; 3 times per day). Biological tests were requested and a biopsy was scheduled a week after. Two biopsies were performed at the inner side of the lower lip and the right lateral edge of the tongue. The result was oral lichen planus ().\nAlmost all the biological tests (VS, CRP, glycated hemoglobin, and thyroid checkup) were within the normal levels, and serologies (hepatitis and VIH) were negative. However, the complete blood count was unusually marked by an increase in the number of red blood cells, hematocrit, and hemoglobin reaching a value of 19 (). This fortuitous finding led us to suspect polycythemia vera and to refer our patient to the department of hematology where he has undergone an emergency phlebotomy. Two days later, he was a victim of a myocardial infraction. He was hospitalized in the cardiology department where he was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, stented, and put under two platelet aggregation inhibitors: Clopidogrel (Plavix) and Acetylsalicylic acid (Kard√©gic).\nThe patient was a candidate for a genetic test looking for the JAK-2(V617F) mutation. The absence of this latter made it possible to rule out the diagnosis of Vasquez's primary polycythemia. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level was high (109 mIU/mL). Bone marrow biopsy was not realized due to bleeding risk. The final diagnosis was secondary polycythemia due to chronic hypoxia.\nThe treatment plan was multidisciplinary. In the hematology department, management of polycythemia with hydroxyurea and allopurinol drugs resulted in a durable remission of the myeloproliferative disorder without toxic side effects and a notable regression in the oral pain. There was an appearance of some pigmented oral lesions possibly related to use of hydroxyurea. In conjunction, in the oral medicine department, oral hygiene conditioning, and a prescription of topical corticosteroid (Prednisolone) and Chlorhexidine-based mouthwashes resulted in a clear improvement of the symptomatology of the patient. Actually, he benefits from regular follow-up appointments in our department as well as in the hematology and cardiology departments. His condition is stable. Improvement of biological variables along the treatment is indicated in .

A 40-year-old woman was referred to The Orthopaedic Oncology Center with a chief complaint of ""pain in my left calf for the past ten years."" She reported that her symptoms of pain in her calf began approximately 10 years ago. She described the pain initially as throbbing in nature that was exacerbated with activity and with ankle dorsiflexion and was relieved with rest and warm compresses. At that time, she noted a mass in her left calf that was about 2 inches in size, which did not fluctuate in size and was nontender. She continued to have mild to moderate pain on a regular basis but did not seek medical attention. Instead, she avoided prolonged walking. Approximately three years ago, the pain became more constant and severe. She began walking with a limp due to the inability to dorsiflex her foot to neutral position and she walked on the tip toes of her left foot. For the past 3 years, she has only been able to walk on her tip toes due to an equinus contracture. Three months prior to presentation, in our office, the patient experienced an acute exacerbation of pain in her left calf and sought medical attention from her primary physician. She was prescribed narcotic analgesia without significant relief of her symptoms. The patient was subsequently referred for an MRI. As initial work-up for this lesion, she had an MRI of the left lower extremity.\nThis showed an ovoid mass centered in the soleus muscle measuring 6.8 cm in the craniocaudal dimension, 5.2 cm in the transverse oblique dimension, and 4.6 cm in the oblique dimension. Edema in the soleus muscle and surrounding musculature were noted ().\nFollowing the MRI, she was referred to the orthopaedic oncology service. She believed that the mass had increased slightly from the time she first noticed it 10 years earlier. She had no other associated symptoms. Her past medical history included only a previous hysterectomy with tubal ligation and unilateral oophorectomy and gastroesophageal reflux. She had no history of prior radiation therapy. The only medication she was taking was low dose narcotics for her pain. Her only allergy was a rash to nitrofurantoin. She was married and denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drug use. She had no family history of sarcomas, only a grandmother with non-small cell lung cancer and a paternal aunt and uncle with adenocarcinoma of the colon and an aunt with uterine cancer. Her physical exam revealed an equinus contracture of 20 degrees with plantar flexion from 20‚Äì30 degrees of the left ankle. There was a well-defined, firm, and tender deep-seated 5 √ó 5 cm soft tissue mass in the midcalf. There were no cutaneous changes or skin discoloration or lymphadenopathy. The mass did not change in size when the extremity was elevated or placed in a dependent position. Though this lesion was suspected to be a benign cavernous hemangioma, due to the patient's significant symptoms, she elected for the resection of her left lower extremity soft tissue tumor.\nAt the time of surgery, a longitudinal incision along the posteromedial aspect of the left leg was made. The plane between the gastrocnemius and soleus was developed and the mass was easily identified. Grossly, there was an irregular red-brown to tan-appearing friable mass intertwined with skeletal muscle with associated large vascular channels consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. Manipulation of the ankle under anesthesia was performed bringing the ankle to 10 degrees of dorsiflexion in order to correct the equinus contracture. She was placed in an ankle dorsiflexion splint postoperatively.

A 60-year-old man with AF was admitted to our hospital after experiencing dyspnea, orthopnea, and a non-productive cough for 2 weeks. The patient had a 10-year history of longstanding persistent AF, four previous radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures (10, 9, and 2 years, and 5 months prior to admission), and a strong family history of AF with ischemic stroke. His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 0 (male, age <60 years old, and no congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism, or vascular disease), and highly symptomatic paroxysmal AF remained after multiple procedures. Although this patient had undergone his 1st and 2nd procedures at another institute and we have limited information based on the medical record, he did show arrhythmogenic PV triggers from the left upper PV. At the 3rd procedure, we had found reconnected PV potentials at the left superior PV and right inferior PV and noted persistence of AF triggers from the left superior PV. Therefore, we had conducted complete circumferential PV isolation and added linear ablations. However, AF recurred as paroxysmal type. At the 4th procedure, all PV isolations and bidirectional blocks of linear ablation were maintained well, and a complex fractionated atrial electrogram-guided ablation was added (). Although a left upper PV trigger occurred during the first three procedures, we did not confirm the exit block by inside PV pacing at the last procedure. To exclude potential epicardial conduction after circumferential PV isolation, inside PV pacing with maximal electrode contact might be important, especially during repeat procedures. There was no evidence of non-PV triggers after electrical cardioversion under isoproterenol infusion. At that time, 75% luminal narrowing of the left superior PV was noticed, but there were no respiratory symptoms. However, the patient became symptomatic with AF recurrence 5 months later, and 3-dimensional-computed tomography (CT) revealed progression of PV stenosis with a significantly atrophied left atrium (). An increased left superior PV systolic peak flow velocity (251 cm/s) with turbulent flow at the PV ostium was observed on the transesophageal echocardiogram (). Based on the diagnosis of clinically significant left superior PV stenosis (), balloon-expandable stent deployment (10√ó19 mm, OMNILINK, Abbott Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) after balloon angioplasty (8√ó20 mm, POWERFLEX, Cordis Inc., Hialeah, FL, USA) () was performed. Sinus rhythm was restored, and the patient exhibited no apparent symptoms related to PV stenosis or AF recurrence 1 day after PV stenting. A follow-up CT performed 12 months after the procedure showed a patent left superior PV (). There was no recurrence of AF based on 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram monitoring based on 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines during regular follow-ups for 2 years ().

A one month old baby girl was brought by her mother to the lactation clinic for further evaluation due to the difficulty of breastfeeding. The mother complained of pain in the nipple which was present throughout the entire breastfeeding session and usually recurred with each episode of breastfeeding. Two weeks after delivery, the mother noticed a tooth on the baby's lower left gum. A week later, she noticed an ulcer under her baby's tongue, which occasionally bled.\nIn light of the continuous pain during breastfeeding, the mother became reluctant to continue and infant formula milk was given as a substitute. Self-examination by the mother did not reveal any nipple crack or breast injury. Her antenatal history was uneventful. There was strong family history of natal teeth, and this baby's siblings had similar problems.\nOn examination, the mother's breast appeared to be normal and consistent with a lactating breast. There was no inflammation or engorgement. Some mild eczema was noted around the nipple, but there was no infection. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were not palpable.\nExamination of the oral cavity of the baby revealed a neonatal tooth over the left anterior region of the mandibular ridge. The tooth measured 2 mm √ó 1 mm in size, was whitish opaque, and had Grade II mobility (Fig. ). There was also a whitish ulcer over the ventral aspect of the tongue measuring 1 mm √ó 1 mm (Fig. ). The parents declined radiological investigations and tongue biopsy for the baby. Hence, the clinical diagnosis was neonatal tooth associated with Riga-Fede disease causing difficulty in breastfeeding.\nThe baby was then referred to the pediatric dental surgery department. After a thorough discussion with the parents, the neonatal tooth was extracted under local anesthesia. The tooth had a crown but lacked a root. Following extraction, the baby did not have any complication such as bleeding and infection. The wound healed well within 2 days and she successfully resumed taking breast feeds.\nCurrently, at 10 months post-extraction, the child is growing well and still breastfeeding. Examination of the oral cavity revealed that only one central lower incisor tooth was present (Fig. ).

A healthy 32-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to emergency room with acute diffuse abdominal and pelvic pain, started 4 hours previously, at 25 weeks of pregnancy. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy. She had no reported history of endometriosis and previous abdominal surgery. Physical examination led to a diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis. Upon admission, temperature was 37.7¬∞C and blood pressure was 110/62 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 18.500/mL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 4.02 mg/dL (normal, 0.2 mg/dL). Abdominal ultrasound revealed minimal fluid around the liver, but neither air nor gross fluid was visible in the abdominal cavity. The obstetric evaluation ruled out an obstetric aetiology of patient's symptoms. The patient underwent an emergency operation for a presumptive diagnosis of acute diffuse peritonitis. Explorative laparoscopy was useful to confirm the clinical suspicion and revealed diffuse severe purulent peritonitis that originated from a double rectal and sigmoid perforation <1 cm in diameter related to an endometriotic nodule, that was confirmed in histopathological findings. A previous adherence, caused by endometriotic nodule, and the progressive traction of the enlarged uterus on the strictly adherent sigmoid colon could be a possible aetiopathogenetic mechanism. The surgical approach, for reduced intraperitoneal operative space, was continued through a median laparotomy. Purulent fluid was found in the abdominal cavity, and with further investigation a left sided sigmoid perforation was found associated with another perforation in rectosigmoid junction that was closed with linear stapler and sigmoid in site of perforation was chosen as stoma in left lateral abdominal wall.
