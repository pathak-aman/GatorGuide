A 75-year-old Caucasian man was admitted for an elective balloon aortic valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis. He had a significant cardiac history including congestive cardiac failure, permanent pacemaker and mitral valve replacement and was on subsequent long-term warfarin anticoagulation. Interestingly, he had a prior left ICS from a spontaneous iliolumbar branch artery bleed that was treated with embolization and fasciotomy from which he made a complete recovery.\nDuring this admission, balloon aortic valvuloplasty was attempted with right femoral artery access obtained via a right groin puncture; unfortunately, the patient became hemodynamically unstable and the procedure was abandoned. Two weeks later, the patient started complaining of severe pain in the right hip. Examination revealed extensive bruising overlying the right groin and decreased hip flexion on the right side with diminished power in the L3–S1 myotomes. Additionally, there was patchy loss of sensation to the anterior right thigh and the dorsum of the right foot. A Doppler ultrasound of the right groin was performed which revealed a 2 cm false aneurysm in the right groin medial to the right common femoral artery. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan was also performed which revealed areas of mesenteric stranding in the right iliac fossa with an enlarged right iliacus muscle measuring 7 × 6.5 cm. The iliacus muscle demonstrated subtle low-attenuation areas in keeping with an iliacus hematoma (Fig. a and b).\nUltrasound guided thrombin injection was performed to treat the pseudoaneurysm. A follow-up CT angiogram demonstrated successful thrombosis of the right CFA pseudoaneurysm and a stable iliacus hematoma with no active iliac arterial extravasation. The patient was taken to the operating theater for an iliacus fasciotomy and hematoma evacuation.\nOn exposure, the retroperitoneal layer was reflected medially and the neurovascular structures were identified and protected. The right iliac vessels were visualized and no active bleeding was seen. A complete fasciotomy of the iliacus compartment was performed and approximately 400 ml of hematoma was evacuated. The anterior abdominal wall was closed in two layers and two drains were inserted into the retroperitoneal space.\nThe patient was admitted to ICU due to respiratory acidosis. He was extubated on postoperative Day 1 and reported marked reduction in his groin pain. He also demonstrated clinical improvement in his right hip flexion though the sensory deficit was unchanged. Unfortunately, on postoperative Day 2 he began deteriorating, requiring increasing inotropic support and ventilatory support with respiratory failure. The following morning the patient passed away from multi-organ failure.

A 59-year-old Thai man was successfully treated with chemoradiation for stage III glottic cancer 3 years prior to presentation. Unfortunately, the tumor recurred and the patient was sent to our clinic for salvage surgery involving a total laryngectomy. Two months after this salvage surgery, the patient developed radionecrosis of the soft tissue of the neck. This necrosis resolved after hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT); however, a large pharyngocutaneous fistula remained in the upper neck ().\nA free flap reconstruction was not suitable for this patient because of his surgical history and severe neck fibrosis. Thus, a two stage, medially based deltopectoral flap reconstruction was chosen. Because the distance requirement was relatively long, we opted for a surgical delay for the distal two-thirds of the flap. The flap was completely elevated and placed on the fistula 10 days after this delay.\nOn postoperative day 5, the flap developed necrosis at its distal tip and was completely separated from the fistula (). The flap tip was trimmed to ~2 cm; however, this postdebridement flap did not have a sufficient length to reach the fistula. After discussion with the patient, we decided to re-operate using this shortened flap rather than harvesting a new flap from the contralateral chest.\nThe revision operation was divided into three stages. In the first stage, we created a temporary recipient site just below and lateral to the fistula. After debridement, the distal part of the flap was placed on this temporary recipient site (). After this stage, the patient underwent another course of HBOT.\nBecause the temporary recipient site was located in a previously irradiated area, the second stage was delayed for 8 weeks, at which point the flap was divided from its origin. The proximal part, which had a reverse blood flow from the temporary recipient site, was transposed upwards to the fistula (). The patient then underwent a third course of HBOT.\nApproximately 6 weeks after the second stage of the operation, the wound was completely healed without saliva leakage (). During the third stage, excess flap tissue was divided and removed (). No further HBOT was administered. By about 1 month after the operation, the patient had resumed regular oral intake.

A 53-year-old woman presented with an open wound on the left lower leg. It was a de-epithelized abrasion and its size was about 3.5 × 1.5 cm2 (Figure A). The patient had no notable medical history. She works as a janitor, and was cleaning the floor of the building, when she spilled undiluted cleansing solution that consisted of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) on her left lower leg. After the accident, an abrasion was noted on that area and she visited her local dermatologic clinic for treatment on the very next day. At the clinic, she received HeNe laser therapy directly to the wound daily for 10 days. The treatment continued for 8 to 9 minutes on each occasion. However, we were unable to determine the details of laser therapy, such as power, wavelength, and so on. The treatment was not beneficial and the wound size was constant. The patient visited our clinic three weeks after the injury and we planned an excision of the unhealed area under the local anesthesia.\nDuring the first operation, the open wound was excised and primary repair was done (Figure B). We sent a specimen to the pathology department and the pathologic analysis revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma, 2 × 1.5 cm2 in size, involving the lateral resection margin. We planned a second operation and evaluated positron emission tomography–computed tomography for metastatic lesions before the second operation. After confirming that there was no metastasis, the patient received a second operation 3 weeks from the first. Wide excision was done with a 2 to 3 cm safe margin (Figure A). During the operation, the resection margin including the tumor base was free from tumors, as demonstrated by a frozen study. The total defect size of the left lower leg measured 9 × 7 cm2 and the defect was successfully reconstructed with a thoracodorsal artery perforator free flap transfer (Figure B,C).

A 52-year-old male patient with abdominal pain was admitted to the Wonju Severance Christian Hospital. His medical history was unremarkable, except for pulmonary tuberculosis, which had been cured with medication 6 months earlier. An intraperitoneal mass was noted on abdominopelvic CT conducted by an external facility ().\nThe patient had mild abdominal pain in the middle of his abdomen that was not associated with food intake or positional change. Upon system review, there were no specific findings such as weight loss. Findings of the physical examination were unremarkable and did not reveal a palpable mass or abdominal tenderness. Laboratory analysis revealed a CEA level of 29.3 ng/mL (standard value: <5 ng/mL), and a markedly increased level of CA 19-9 of up to 4881 U/mL (standard value: <5 U/mL). Other laboratory results were within normal ranges.\nChest CT revealed improved pulmonary tuberculosis and an approximately 4.3-cm-sized cystic mass in the sub-gastric area; the internal contents of the mass showed an enhanced density greater than that of the surrounding fluid. The mass contained a partially calcified region and was not attached to an adjacent organ such as the stomach or small intestine.\nThe endoscopy finding from an external facility indicated only chronic superficial gastritis. There was no visible mass or mass effect lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was available for further evaluation of the mass because it was located near the lower border of the stomach. On EUS, the mass was found to be in the extra-gastric area and presented as a cystic feature with an internally mixed echoic pattern, and the cystic mass wall had both an inner smooth hyperechoic mucosal layer (, arrow a) and an outer hypoechoic muscular layer (, arrow b).\nOn the basis of these findings, we diagnosed this case as a malignant gastrointestinal tumor or malignant lymph node and performed surgery. The entire cyst was excised without disturbing the normal bowel or mesenteric anatomy. The mass featured a well-encapsulated oval shape (). During surgery, we found that the mass was located in the peritoneum, was not attached to the small bowel or stomach, and had a separate feeding vessel. Upon a gross sectional inspection, the mass was a 4×3×3-cm unilocular cyst filled with dark brown necrotic material that appeared to comprise hemorrhagic contents. The cyst wall was evenly thin with focally located, ill-defined yellowish-brown mural nodules (). Upon microscopic examination, the cyst wall was found to be composed of an inner columnar epithelial lining, 2 smooth muscle layers, and serosa, thus mimicking the intestine. However, the epithelial lining of the entire cyst consisted of gland-forming neoplastic columnar epithelium, which was characterized by a loss of nuclear polarity, a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and hyperchromasia, without spared non-neoplastic epithelium (). Focal areas of invasion into the smooth muscle were observed, and the cyst wall contained multifocal cholesterol granulomas that matched the yellowish nodules observed during the gross examination (). The immunohistochemical stains were positive for cytokeratin 20 and negative for cytokeratin 7 in the neoplastic epithelial lining of the cyst (). These findings were consistent with an adenocarcinoma that had arisen from the intestinal duplication cyst.\nThere were no metastases or local cancer invasion, according to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT. No postoperative complications occurred, the patient remains well, and the tumor marker levels had decreased to within normal ranges at follow-up.

We were provided with a right kidney from a 55-year-old male donation after brain death donor who had died as a result of an intracerebral haemorrhage. The kidney had a single renal artery with aortic patch and a single ureter but there were dual renal veins. The main hilar renal vein had a diameter of 12 mm, the lower polar vein had a diameter of 8 mm and the veins were separated by a distance of 4 cm. The veins had been divided at the level of the inferior vena cava; a caval tube had not been provided.\nThe recipient was a 47-year-old female with a body mass index of 28.5 m2/kg and end-stage renal failure secondary to chronic pyelonephritis. The kidney was implanted into the right iliac fossa. The main hilar renal vein was anastomosed end to side to the external iliac vein using 5/0 polypropylene and the renal arterial patch was anastomosed end to side to the external iliac artery using 5/0 polypropylene. The lower polar vein was controlled with a fine atraumatic vascular clamp and not anastomosed initially. On release of the arterial and venous clamps, the kidney appeared globally well perfused and some urine production was observed. Nonetheless, both the main hilar and lower polar veins were distended and felt congested. On-table Doppler ultrasound was performed by members of the surgical team. This confirmed that the kidney was globally perfused but the waveforms showed reversal of flow in diastole throughout the kidney. The external iliac vein was clamped inferior to the upper renal vein anastomosis and at the inguinal ligament and the lower polar vein was then anastomosed end to side to the external iliac vein using 5/0 prolene (). On clamp release the kidney's appearance improved immediately and both renal veins became soft and easily compressible. A repeat intraoperative Doppler ultrasound examination demonstrated excellent perfusion of the whole kidney and a triphasic waveform with forward flow in diastole. These findings were confirmed in the recovery room by an experienced radiologist. The cold ischaemic time was 12 h 18 min and the anastomosis time was initially 32 min with a further 10 min for the lower polar venous anastomosis. The kidney had initial function and at 12 month follow-up the recipient's serum creatinine was 103 μmol/l.

A 61-year-old man was presented to our department with epigastric discomfort, general weakness, weight loss (~14 kg in 4 months), constipation, melena and vomiting for the last 4 months of solid intake 1 h after each meal. There was a good tolerance to liquid intake.\nPhysical examination revealed that the patient was afebrile, slightly pale, hemodynamically stable with no jaundice. We noticed an abdominal scar of midline incision and a mild tenderness in epigastrium. No organomegaly was found.\nPreviously, 1 month ago, the patient was admitted for the same complaints. He underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which was unsuccessful because of the residual food in his stomach. The patient was put on omeprazole 20 mg twice daily with a re-evaluation after a month.\nThe patient's past surgical history included perforated benign first portion of duodenal ulcer 15 years ago (treated by primary closure and graham patch) and cholecystoctomy with no other significant medical history.\nAdmission work-up is shown in Table .\nAn upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed again after having the patient fast overnight with these findings (Fig. ): residual food in stomach, pyloric edema and severe stenosis of the bulb that prevented us from progressing further into the small intestine. Biopsies were taken from the bulb and the atrophic mucosa of antrum. Histopathology revealed mild chronic atrophic gastritis and non-specific chronic duodenitis with no findings of either helicobacter pylori infection or malignancy. Colonoscopy, on the other hand, was within normal.\nIntravenous contrast computed tomography showed thickening of proximal gastric and pyloric walls and a mild dilatation of extra- and intra-hepatic bile ducts, although the head of pancreas was normal (Fig. ).\nThe primary diagnosis was gastric outlet obstruction due to a complicated benign duodenal ulcer. The diagnosis was based on the benign endoscopic histopathology findings of the bulb and the rarity of duodenal malignancy. The decision then was to perform elective laparotomy because of both refractory symptoms despite of medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors and the lack of medical experience in endoscopic dilation in the hospital. During surgery, we found severe adhesions caused by the previous surgery which required careful adhesiolysis. The stomach was dilated and thick-walled. A stenosis of duodenal bulb was also detected. Surprisingly, we palpated a mass (5 × 7 cm) arising from the posterior lower half of greater curvature extending to the lesser sac. Anatomically, this mass (Fig. ) represents a gastro-duodenal fourth segment fistula.\nThe surgical steps were (Fig. ): Antrectomy, resection of the fourth duodenum, end to end third duodenojejunostomy, Omega-Braun gastrojejunostomy, feeding jejunostomy and drainage. Histopathology study revealed a perforated benign gastric ulcer (Fig. ).\nWith a strict post-operative follow-up (shown in Table ) for the patient, he was discharged home in 9 days.

An 11-month-old male patient was referred to our department with the chief complaint of a ""little ball"" in the lower lip and that he had difficulty in sucking for more than 3 months. The baby was in good general health and no other symptoms were reported. Oral habits or a local trauma was not reported. The clinical examination revealed the presence of a soft tissue nodule on the lower lip mucosa () which was similar in color to the oral mucosa measuring approximately 5 cm at its widest diameter with a sessile base, flaccid consistency, clearly defined limits, and a smooth surface. Based on detailed history and clinical examination a provisional diagnosis of mucocele was made. After medical evaluation, and signed informed consent from the parents, an excisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia. Due to the lack of baby's contribution, considering his little age, and as the procedure was simple, a decision was taken in favor of the physical containment (protective stabilization) with consent and aid of the parents: laying the baby on the chair, the mother laying over him holding the hands, and the assistant holding the baby's head. As the baby was crying continuously, it helped in keeping the mouth open. A local infiltrative anesthesia (2% lignocaine with epinephrine 1 : 80,000; one cartridge) was infiltrated around the lesion. Before infiltration, a topical anesthetic gel for 2 minutes was applied. The lip was then everted with digital pressure to increase the lesion's prominence. A thick silk thread was passed through the lesion at its largest diameter and a surgical knot was made followed by excisional biopsy using electrocautery (Figures and ), hence minimizing the chances of pain and postoperative bleeding. An analgesic was prescribed on the first postoperatory day to prevent any possible pain that could result in stress for the baby. The specimen was sent for histopathologic analysis which identified a large central mucous pooled area consisting of mucinophages, mucin containing cells, surrounded by compressed connective tissue wall, and forming granulation tissue () and confirmed the diagnosis as mucocele. After 2 hours, the patient recovered normal breastfeeding. The child reported uneventful recovery and an improved dietary habit one week postoperatively.\nThe baby was reexamined after 15 days and 6 and 12 months. No recurrence was observed after 12 months ().

Left eye examination was normal with a visual acuity of 6/12 (20/40). She had no signs of meningism and the rest of cranial nerve examination was normal. The rest of the systems examination was normal.\nFull blood count, urea and electrolytes and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal. Rapid Plasma Reagin for syphilis was negative, C-reactive protein was less than 10 mg/L and a rapid HIV test was negative. Coagulation studies were normal and D-dimer was negative. Computed Tomographic (CT) scan (Fig. ) showed bilateral maxillary sinus, right ethmoidal, frontal and sphenoidal opacification. The superior ophthalmic veins were bilaterally enhancing with no filling defects. There was no caroto-cavernous sinus pathological enhancement seen. There were no retro-bulbar lesions noted, no orbital or pre-septal orbital cellulitis. There were no intracranial lesions noted, no ipsilateral bony defects of lamina papyracea, optic canal or lateral sphenoidal wall noted (Fig. ). There were no bony lesions noted in relation to the skull base in the midline.\nThere was no obvious direct link between loss of vision and the sinusitis, nevertheless a decision was taken to start the patient empirically on intravenous Amoxicillin/ Clavulanate (1.2 g three times a day) and perform emergency functional endoscopic sinus surgery. She was taken to theatre within 24 h of admission to the ENT ward (approximately 5 days since onset of loss of vision) where she had bilateral middle meatus antrostomy with maxillary sinus washout, right total ethmoidectomy, right sphenoidotomy and right frontal sinusotomy. Pus was found in both maxillary sinuses as well as in the anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses on the right side, the sphenoid sinus had oedematous mucosa. There was oedematous mucosa in the left sphenoid and frontal sinuses with no pus. The right side was packed with Merocel® (Medtronic Xomed Inc) postoperatively.\nNasal pack was removed on day 1 postoperatively and nasal douche as well as steroid spray was commenced. She completed a 3 day methylprednisone course and continued on intravenous Amoxicillin/Clavulanate. She had no periorbital swelling and remained stable. The patient reported an improvement in vision day 1 post operatively.\nIntraoperative swabs taken from maxillary sinus revealed Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus susceptible to Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. This was reported as a moderate growth on culture and was also picked up on microscopy. Specific identification was done by Lancefield grouping as well as the automated Vitek® 2 system. Histology of intra operative sinus tissue reported that the features were in keeping with chronic allergic sinusitis; no fungi demonstrated, no features of an osteitis, no granulomas or viral inclusions and no tumor. She had progressive subjective improvement in vision and had normal eye examination findings with a visual acuity of 6/9 (20/30) in both eyes on discharge, 4 days postoperatively. She was reviewed by a neurologist pre- and post-operatively and diagnosed with 'neighbourhood syndrome'. Further imaging was deferred given the marked and complete recovery post surgery and antibiotics. She was discharged home on oral Amoxicillin/Clavulanate to be continued for another 10 days and long term nasal douche and Fluticasone nasal spray.\nTwo week and 4 week follow-ups were unremarkable; vision was still maintained and nasal mucosa inflammation had subsided.

Discharge: No information","[Start clinical note:]
A 44-year-old Hispanic male with no known history was brought to the emergency department (ED) via Emergency Medical Services (EMS) after being shot in the chest, abdomen, and left shoulder. With EMS, the patient was conscious and had a stable pulse. In the trauma bay, the patient became unresponsive with a loss of pulse, and CPR was initiated. Upon physical examination, the patient was observed to have one high-caliber GSW to the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, one high-caliber GSW to the left periumbilical region of the abdomen, one high-caliber GSW to the fourth intercostal space of the left chest just medial to the midclavicular line with an expanding hematoma, and one high-caliber GSW to the left shoulder with a floating left shoulder. In the ED, a left thoracotomy, along with a central line and endotracheal intubation, was performed to release a pericardial tamponade that was likely caused by gunshot trauma to the heart. Cardiac massage and MTPs were initiated and an aortic cross-clamp was placed. Palpable pulses were achieved with the support of cardiac massage and MTPs after the release of a pericardial tamponade via pericardiotomy and multiple rounds of epinephrine. Following this ED course, the patient was immediately transported to the operating room (OR) for DCR surgery and MTP.\nUpon arrival in the OR, the patient was aggressively resuscitated with high doses of epinephrine for vascular support. The thoracic cavity was surgically explored first. The patient was unstable due to active bleeding from a left hilar and left upper lobe injury. A left lung hilar clamp was placed to control the active bleeding while a tractotomy repair of the left lung injury was completed. The left hilar lung clamp was then released with minimal active bleeding from the site of the lung injury. Once this bleeding was controlled, an inspection of the remainder of the thoracic cavity began. At this time, the ascending arch and the descending portions of the aorta appeared intact. Upon further inspection, there was a hematoma and injury to the left subclavian vein which was immediately packed with gauze, and pressure was applied. Inspection and irrigation of the remainder of the thoracic cavity revealed no additional hemorrhagic injuries. During this time, the patient also received massive transfusions of pRBCs, platelets, and plasma.\nImmediately after stabilizing the thoracic cavity of any hemorrhaging, exploration of the abdominal cavity commenced with a midline exploratory laparotomy incision. A liter of clotted blood was discovered upon opening the abdominal cavity. The four abdominal quadrants were initially inspected and significant injury to the omentum was found. Solid organs were inspected next, with no injuries observed to the liver, kidneys, spleen, or pancreas. Finally, the bowel was run from the distal esophagus to the colon with no evidence of injury along the alimentary tract. After careful inspection, the abdomen was packed to provide hemostasis for the omental injuries, and attention was focused back on the chest.\nSignificant oozing and bleeding from a tributary of the left subclavian vein were noted from the left shoulder upon reinspection of the chest. This tributary was clipped to control the active bleeding. Following this, the soft tissue bleeding surrounding the left chest and shoulder region was controlled via electrocautery and suture ligature. Further inspection of the left shoulder indicated an extensive left shoulder fracture with significant bone loss. Additionally, there was significant bleeding from the bone fracture itself. This was also packed with gauze for hemostasis, and a bullet fragment was removed from the left shoulder. After controlling the bleeding left chest and shoulder, a reinspection of the entire thoracic cavity indicated no further hemorrhage from the noted sites of injury or any additional sites.\nAfter confirming that the patient was hemodynamically improving with high doses of epinephrine and continuous MTPs via arterial blood gas (ABG) and vital sign monitoring, the decision was made to attempt to release the aortic cross-clamp. To begin, the intrathoracic aortic cross-clamp was only partially released with good toleration from the patient. As the patient continued to tolerate this partial release, the sequential decision was made to release the intrathoracic aortic cross-clamp completely. At this time, the patient continued to hemodynamically tolerate the complete release of the cross-clamp; however, he was observed to have decreased chest movement of his right chest. A right thoracostomy tube was placed with 900 cc of bloody output. Attention was focused back on the abdomen for a reinspection that indicated no bleeding in addition to the ligated omental bleed. The abdominal cavity was then left open, packed with a wound vac sponge, and sealed with a wound vac in accordance with damage control surgery protocol. A reinspection of the thoracic cavity indicated no additional obvious bleeding, and hemodynamic values via vitals and ABG monitoring were stable at this point. The decision was made to close the thoracic cavity with the consent of the cardiothoracic surgeon who had arrived for a consultation. Two left chest tubes and one right chest tube were placed upon closure of the thoracic cavity.\nNotably, throughout the DCR surgery, serial ABGs were monitoring the progress of the MTPs and trending the pH and coagulation values. In total, the patient was transfused with 18 units of pRBCs, 12 units of fresh frozen plasma, and three units of platelets with epinephrine and calcium for support of MTPs. CBC, coagulation, and ABG monitoring findings are listed in Table . During this operation, a continuous cardiac massage and warm saline were also administered to the heart. Additionally, an external convective warming blanket and additional cloth blankets were utilized, and the operating room temperature was raised to 80°F to prevent hypothermia and counteract the onset of this part of the lethal triad. The patient's estimated blood loss was 5 L and 150 mL of urine was produced by the end of the surgery. The patient was also noted to be positive for coronavirus disease 2019. Radiological findings are demonstrated in Figures -. Surgical visualizations are demonstrated in Figures -.

A 51-year-old Japanese man who was born and raised in Japan and did not have any underlying medical condition presented with a rectal mass. He underwent endoscopic biopsy of the lesion, and the histopathological report showed spindle-shaped tumor cells with mild cytological atypia. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor was positive for CD117 (c-kit) and CD34, leading to the diagnosis of a rectal GIST. He underwent colectomy after shrinking the tumor with 400 mg/day of imatinib for 9 months. After completion of treatment, annual follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans showed no local recurrence or distant internal organ metastases. His postoperative course was good and he could continue working as a judo therapist. There was nothing notable in his medical history, except for the rectal GIST, and he did not take any medication after surgery. His family history was uneventful and he did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol.\nAlthough he was asymptomatic, a CT scan 10 years after surgery revealed a destructive osteolytic lesion in the L3 vertebral body (Fig. ). CT-guided biopsy confirmed the lesions to be GIST metastases. His vital signs were stable with blood pressure 128/64, pulse rate 68 beats/minute, and temperature 36.3 °C. Sensations were normal in both lower limbs. His muscle strength was grade M5 throughout (Medical Research Council Scale of Muscle Strength), and deep tendon reflexes were normal. Laboratory testing showed a normal complete blood count (CBC). His liver and renal functions were sufficient, and the electrolytes were normal. As there were no metastases in vital organs and the tumor was located only in the anterior column of the vertebra, en bloc corpectomy of the L3 vertebral body was performed to provide local cure of the tumor and to prevent devastating sequelae of neural compression.\nEn bloc corpectomy via bilateral anterolateral retroperitoneal approaches was performed. Major vascular structures and the psoas muscles were retracted to expose the vertebral body and adjacent discs. The L3 vertebral body was cut off from the posterior elements using high-speed drills and chisels, and was removed en bloc. A titanium cage, with an autologous bone graft inside, was placed into the vertebral defect, and the spinal reconstruction procedure was finalized using screws and rods (Fig. ).\nThe pathological finding of the resected vertebral body was consistent with GIST metastasis, and the surgical margin was negative. Laboratory testing 3 days after the surgery showed slightly low hemoglobin (127 g/L, reference range 135–170 g/L) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 114 mg/L (reference range < 3 mg/L). His liver enzymes were elevated: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 112 U/L (reference range < 35 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 40 U/L (reference range < 35 U/L). CRP, ALT, and AST levels completely normalized within 1 month after surgery. In repeated laboratory tests, CBC, CRP, and liver enzymes remained normal until the final follow-up. At the 36-month follow-up, no local recurrence, new metastasis, or instrumentation failure was observed on CT or magnetic resonance imaging. He had full neurological functions without any limitation of daily activities.

A 5-year-old Caucasian female presented to the outpatient clinic with her parents in 2001 complaining of being unable to use a pen with her right hand.\nAt first examination, the thumb was seen at adduction and flexion position, it cannot be extended, and after passive extension, it returns to original adduction and flexion position ().\nThere was a contracture and absence at the first web and the thumb was smaller than the opposite left one.\nThere was no extension in the interphalangeal joint due to the absence of EPL, also in the metacarpophalangeal joint due to the absence of EPB, whereas the CMC joint was stable.\nThe following movements: flexion, adduction and opposition were within normal.\nNeither stiffness nor instability in interphalangeal (IP) or metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints was observed ().\nThe deformity was isolated as no bones were missing in her body and she was not suffering from any syndromes. Also, no similar cases were reported in her family history.\nWe ensured the diagnosis of congenital clasped thumb deformity with hypoplastic thumb. We did not face any difficulty with the differential diagnosis between this situation and neonatal trigger thumb because of the late presence of the patient at the age of 5 years. The late presence and the absence of EPL and EPB made the conservative treatment with splinting no more successful and the reconstructive surgery the only proper way to achieve good results.\nThe surgery was performed in one stage, it took 90 min under general anesthesia, a tourniquet was applied on the upper right arm and the first web was obtained by performing an expansion surgery with simple z-plasty. Then, a drill-hole was made in the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb, where the extensor indicis proprius (EIP) tendon was passed through and sutured to itself, while the end of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) of the ring finger was sewed to the end of the distal phalanx and fixed with a button, and the thumb was placed at full abduction and extension position and fixed with a K-wire (Kirschner wire) inserted from distal to proximal ().\nA supporting splint of the forearm and thumb was applied and then replaced with below elbow cast after removing the stitches two weeks after the surgery ().\nSix weeks later, the cast and the K-wire were removed.

She did not marry due to the lymphedema and complained of the frequent occurrence of strangers staring at her leg, which upset her. The physical examination confirmed elephantiasis. The circumference of the left lower limb was 106 cm. Her body weight was 106 kilograms, height was 160 cm, and the body mass index (BMI) was 41.6 kg/m2 ().\nThe patient was submitted to intensive treatment for three weeks, which led to a 21 kg reduction in weight and 66 cm reduction in leg circumference ().\nIntensive treatment with the Godoy Method consisted of eight hours per day of mechanical lymphatic drainage, 15 minutes of simultaneous cervical lymphatic therapy, and hand-crafted compression stockings made from grosgrain fabric. Mechanical lymphatic therapy consisted of an electromechanical device that performs plantar flexion and extension. After three weeks of intensive therapy, the patient continued treatment at home using the compression stockings. At the follow-up evaluation, the patient was submitted to electrical bioimpedance analysis as well as circumference measurements and volumetry. The bioimpedance analysis revealed a pattern of normality, with the reduction in lymphedema. Ten years after treatment, the patient has maintained the results with the compression stockings. In occupational therapy throughout this period, the patient has been encouraged to perform activities that she has always wanted to do to improve her wellbeing. She took up belly dancing, followed by tap dancing. She reports that these activities changed her life and she is very happy for being able to realize her dream of dancing, which is an activity that she began at the age of 76 years. The study was approving Ethical Committee of Medicine School of Sao Jose do Rio Preto# 2.929.115.

A 10-year old boy presented with a recurrent abdominal wall tumor. The patient had an incomplete surgery 3 years earlier and had undergone two surgeries subsequently for recurrent swellings. There was neither history of trauma or any family history of similar swellings. Clinically the mass was 8 × 6 cm involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue with an 11 cm horizontal scar with prominent hatch marks and a separate drain site scar (Figure ). Computerised tomography scan revealed a hypodense, ovoid mass measuring 3.8 × 7.9 × 8.4 cm infiltrating the rectus sheath with no obvious intra-abdominal extension (Figure ).\nCore needle biopsy was suggestive of DFSP. Surgical excision was planned with a wide margin of 2 cm and excising the entire rectus sheath (both anterior and posterior layers along with the muscles). The skin with the linear scar, hatch marks and the drain site scar were included in the resection (Figure ). Since there was no intra-abdominal extension, the peritoneum was left intact except at one place where the tumor was abutting it (Figures , ). Due to the sparse underlying omentum, placement of intraperitoneal mesh was deferred. The peritoneum was mobilized all around until the lateral abdominal wall and a primary closure of peritoneum was achieved (Figure ). A pre-peritoneal VYPRO® mesh was placed and anchored to the peritoneum (Figure ). A free anterolateral thigh flap was harvested from the thigh and microvascular anastamosis was performed between the flap vasculature (cutaneous perforators of the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex vessels) and the deep inferior epigastric vessels (Figure ). The deep fascia of the flap was sutured to the rectus sheath and skin approximated (Figure ).\nThe patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital on the eighth postoperative day. All surgical resection margins were negative. The closest margin was 2 mm microscopically although grossly it was 12 mm away. The patient received postoperative radiotherapy (5,040 cGy/28#). At first follow up after three months the flap is well healed and the patient is disease free.

A 44-year-old male without any specific medical history visited the emergency department of our hospital with complaints of a headache and irritability that had been preceded by a fever for the past five days. After several hours, he had a generalized tonic seizure and respiratory insufficiency requiring endotracheal intubation. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a white blood cell count of 45/mm3 (lymphocyte 92%), protein level of 90.1 mg/dL, and glucose level of 46 mg/dL. On neurological examination, he showed a stuporous mental status and flaccid grade 3 paralysis in both upper limbs and grade 1 in both lower limbs. We used the Medical Research Council (MRC) grading. He was generally areflexic, and there was no pyramidal tract sign.\nAn initial brain MRI showed patchy and subtle T2 hyperintensity of both the hippocampal gyri and left thalamus. Follow-up imaging performed on the 28th day revealed more marked and extended lesions in the bilateral hippocampal gyri, thalamus, and basal ganglia (). At that time, nerve conduction studies (NCSs) showed slightly decreased amplitudes of bilateral median and ulnar compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) with normal distal latencies and conduction velocities. Furthermore, the somatosensory evoked potentials of median and tibial nerves revealed normal latencies. The diagnosis of JE was confirmed by positive JE virus IgM in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rising titer in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on the 31st day and 40th day, respectively.\nOn the 62nd day, the patient was transferred to the rehabilitation unit. The motor power was grade 0 to 1 in the right upper and lower limbs, grade 2 in the left upper limb, and grade 3 in the left lower limb in terms of the MRC grading and profound muscle wasting was noted. The patient showed a mixed pattern of the deep tendon reflex (DTR) as follows: hyperactive knee jerk as opposed to hypoactive biceps, triceps and ankle jerk. His score of Modified Barthel Index (MBI) was zero.\nOn the 71st day, follow-up NCSs and electromyography (EMG) was performed using Medelec Synergy EMG equipment (Oxford Instrument Medical Ltd., Surrey, UK). It revealed decreased amplitudes of bilateral median CMAPs () and profuse abnormal spontaneous activities (ASAs) in all sampled muscles of the upper and lower limbs, as well as the trunk (). The motor evoked potentials from both the abductor pollicis brevis and abductor hallucis muscles revealed decreased amplitudes of evoked potentials. A whole spine MRI on the 77th day showed syrinx formation at the C5 level of the spinal cord on the T2-weighted image (). A follow-up brain MRI and diffusion tensor tractography on the 86th day demonstrated an improvement in lesions of the hippocampal gyri, thalamus, and basal ganglia. In addition, the corticospinal tract revealed preserved integrity of the tract (). After physical and occupational therapy with sessions twice a day, five days a week, motor power was improved, progressing to grade 3 in the upper limbs and grade 3 to 4 in the lower limbs in terms of the MRC grading, and MBI also improved to 23 at discharge on the 104th day.

A 45-year-old Caucasian obese woman presented with small painful ulcers on the back of her hands and fingers that had started three weeks prior to her visit. She first noticed small red flat discolored areas which gradually worsened by developing pain, swelling, and ulcers within two weeks. She did not recall a prior trauma. She had a history of previous laparoscopic gastric sleeve surgery for morbid obesity and a vague diagnosis of mild diabetes for which she was not on any medication. She denied taking a new drug. With the clinical diagnosis of an infectious process, bacterial culture and sensitivity were performed and she was given oral and topical antibiotics (Bactrim and mupirocin, respectively) along with wound care instructions. The patient started developing fever with malaise and was admitted to the emergency room, where she was placed on intravenous antibiotic (vancomycin) due to suspicion of sepsis, originating from her ""hand infection"". After a few days, she returned to our clinic. Compared to the original visit, the condition appeared worse with development of erythematous ulcerated nodules and plaques, violaceous borders, and marked surrounding edema, present on the dorsal aspects of right index and left ring fingers along with proximal metacarpophalangeal joint of third digit. The fingers in the nonulcerated areas displayed a fusiform swelling (Figures and ). She also developed tender indurated erythematous plaques on the dorsum of the right wrist. Examination of the rest of the body, including the mucosal surfaces, failed to show any involvement. Based on the clinical progression and lack of response to antibiotics, biopsy was obtained to rule out atypical pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), deep fungal or mycobacterial infection, or other possibilities. Histopathologic examination revealed marked subepidermal edema associated with a superficial and deep perivascular, interstitial, and diffuse infiltrate of neutrophils, many of which were present within the vessel walls, associated with leukocytoclasia and extravasation of erythrocytes. Despite vasculopathic changes, there was no evidence of true vasculitis (Figures , , and ). Although the histopathologic differential diagnosis was most consistent with Sweet's syndrome, based on the clinical presentation, NDDH was the rendered diagnosis. She was immediately started on oral prednisone 80mg per day. In the meantime, a systemic workup was carried out. After a week, the ulcers were already healing and the swelling was subsiding. Tissue cultures yielded negative results and systemic workup was normal. We started to taper down the prednisone at this point. One week later, there was continued flattening of the lesions. After one month, there was mild residual erythema at the previous sites (Figures and ). We continued to taper down her prednisone and prescribed a potent topical corticosteroid in case of local recurrence. She reported complete clearing of the lesions. Seven months later, she presented with a mildly erythematous patch on the dorsum of right third digit. An intralesional steroid injection was performed followed by topical steroids for two weeks. She has not had any recurrence, after one year from the original incidence.

Discharge: No information","[Start clinical note:]
A was a 13-year-old boy referred to the inpatient unit for severe social withdrawal with school dropout since a year and a half. He had no prior psychiatric or medical history. He lived with his identical twin sister and his mother. The father had died 2 years ago from lung cancer. The twins were born prematurely at 34 weeks, but no delay in psychomotor acquisitions was reported.\nFollowing the death of his father, A started to develop isolation and social withdrawal. Around the same period, he started playing at a construction game on his computer. The time spent in this activity increased, and the patient gave up school and other activities. Over the past year, A played 10 to 12 h per day with no period free of playing longer than 1 day. When not gaming, A was irritable, vindictive, and verbally aggressive. In addition, gaming did not involve any socializing aspects (e.g., forum or online competition). During the last 6 months, he was completely confined to his room (except for personal hygiene) spending almost all of the daytime playing the video game. All the family's attempts to help him reduce gaming failed. The patient actively refused to meet mental health professionals, and during home visits, he stayed locked in his room.\nAt admission, the patient appeared to be a discrete boy. He looked sad and withdrawn with minimal verbal interaction. The speech was monotone and overly soft with many pauses and, in particular, reluctant to talk about his thoughts. A was particularly careful to pick the right word to answer questions. He expressed a pervasive feeling of hollowness and a loss of interest in his surroundings. His mood was poorly influenced by external circumstances. He described the feeling as being emotionally paralyzed rather than sadness. A reported no pessimistic thoughts or feelings of hopelessness; however, he was unable to project himself into the future and had no motivation to perform any activities other than gaming. Sleep and appetite were preserved and no delusion was reported. The diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (F34.1) was made ().\nPrior to the onset of the current depressive disorder, A experienced socio-emotional and interpersonal difficulties. He shared his emotional experiences only on rare occasions and was reluctant to seek support for basic or emotional needs. As a child he is described as frequently embarrassed in new and unfamiliar situations, with few behavioral strategies to manage his emotion. The restriction of facial and voice affect, initially interpreted as a sign of depressive mood, was reported since an early age.\nDuring medical interviews, A's mother presented poor emotional insight. Her voice and face expressed deep sadness, but she was reluctant to discuss her feelings. Questions about the relations between family grief, the impact on each family member, and A's psychiatric symptoms were eluded. She never mentioned her own social phobia that we discovered long after this hospitalization. In fact, it turned out that the weekly appointments to the adolescent outpatient care service were her only source of relational contacts. About gaming, she felt helpless in monitoring the gaming use. She agreed to receive behavioral guidance but never managed to apply any suggestions. Her motivation to change the current situation at home seemed low.\nA was treated with an antidepressant, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), sertraline up to 75 mg/day. In the ward, he was involved in different activities with other inpatients in view of promoting positive experiences with adults and peers. He seemed more open and talkative with the paramedical staff and with other youths than during the medical interviews. He had a weekly support group and a group for behavioral and substance-related addictive disorders. The patient started school readaptation a few hours per day.\nAfter 4 weeks, the patient felt progressively better. During permissions at home, A is described as more dynamic and emotionally reactive. He started to enjoy usual interests with other members of the family and actively sought out friendship in planning lunch during the weekend with adolescents met at the hospital. Progressively, he spent less time playing video games (around 2 h per day) without anxiety when not playing.\nDespite the clinical and functional improvement, both A and his mother seemed unable to identify external or internal factors that contributed to A's depressive disorder and gaming misuse. They did not express any worries regarding possible relapse. For both of them, mental projections into the past or the future were nearly impossible or were unrealistic. For example, despite a year and a half without being at school, A and his mother declined all school adaptations.
