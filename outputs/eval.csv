A 42-year-old, G3P2 L0 presented to the obstetrics outpatient department in the second trimester of her third pregnancy for a routine antenatal check up. She had two still births in the past, the details of which are not known. She is not a hypertensive or diabetic. There was no history of any drug intake except for iron and folic acid supplementation. Her routine hematological and biochemical investigations were within normal limits. A routine anomalous scan done at 2nd trimester showed a fetus with features of intrauterine growth retardation along with a large fluid-filled sac in the abdominal region which was compressing the thorax. Both upper and lower extremities were visualized. However, due to oligohydraminos no further comment could be made upon the fetal anatomy. Color flow showed two umbilical arteries along the wall of the cyst. The intraabdominal unilocular cystic mass was assumed to be the urinary bladder and in conjunction with the presence of oligohydraminos and Intrauterine growth retardation a proposed diagnosis of congenital megacystitis or Prune Belly Syndrome was made [Figures and ]. The parents were informed about the diagnosis and after counseling, they opted for termination of pregnancy. The pregnancy was terminated after obtaining the consent, and the abortus was sent for pathological examination.\nAt autopsy, the fetus weighed 75 g and on external examination a number of anomalies were noted. The genitalia were ambiguous. Encephalocoele was seen over the head of the fetus in the occipital region. The most striking abnormality was a left sided anterior abdominal wall defect, from which gastrointestinal organs were protruding. The organs identified included the liver and the intestine. Although these organs were not encased by a membrane, a membrane like structure was present near the anterior abdominal wall opening [Figures and ]. A defect in the posterior abdominal wall was also noted. A number of skeletal abnormalities were noticed. There were scoliosis and amelia of the digits of the right upper limb. The lower limbs exhibited malrotation and were pushed to the right lateral side by the protruding abdominal organs []. The umbilical cord was short and was found in a membrane like structure that was partially covering some of the protruding organs. A radiological examination was also done, which confirmed the gross skeletal anomalies and the encephalocele []. On internal examination, there was agenesis of anal canal along with agenesis of genitourinary tract, and the lungs were hypoplastic. The remaining organs appeared normal on gross examination and congested on microscopy. In view of the above combination of malformations, a diagnosis of LBWC was offered.

A 73-year-old male patient, who we knew to have had COPD and CABG, came to our clinic with uT3. No poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma at distal part of the esophagus was found. Endoscopy showed a 3.5 cm segment of narrowing in the lower third of the esophagus. He did not receive induction chemoradiotherapy before surgery.\nThe patient underwent an open transhiatal esophagectomy and reconstruction by gastric pull-up according to Orringer's technique.\nPostoperative outcome was acceptable at first days and the patient was extubated successfully. On the 8th postoperative day, however, our patient developed dyspnea, cough, and respiratory distress. Intubation was therefore performed again. The patient underwent conservative management with supportive care and on the 30th postoperative day the patient was extubated successfully. During the next 6 days the patient developed respiratory distress with metabolic acidosis. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral basal consolidation with diffuse patchy infiltration. Consequently, the patient underwent intubation again. When the patient was reintubated, plenty large amount of bilious fluid was extracted from the endotracheal tube. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in the ICU and a fistula was detected 6 cm above the carina, just adjacent to the site of esophagogastric anastomosis. On the basis of bronchoscopic finding and clinical evidences, the diagnosis of gastrotracheal fistula was confirmed.\nBecause of the patient's bad general condition, conservative management and endoscopic approach for insertion of a stent in the trachea were not allowed. After a multidisciplinary team consultation, the patient was scheduled for operative intervention.\nAt the 1st operation, we carried out the left side neck exploration through the previous incision site. It showed severe inflammation and adhesion. A partial sternotomy was done to allow better access and exposure to the high retrotracheal portion of the esophagus []. After insertion of a nasogastric tube above the level of esophagogastric anastomosis, methylene blue was injected via NG tube to clarify the site of leakage. No leakage of dye appeared in the operating field. Then the gastric tube and cervical esophagus were mobilized and freed from fibrosis and adhesions. A fistula tract was identified in the posterior aspect of the anastomosis adjacent to the trachea. It was transected and repaired with interrupted primary sutures. Because the location of fistula was in the neck adjacent to the esophagogastric anastomosis, we could not interpose an intercostal muscle bundle, pericardial, pleural, or omental flap to protect the suture lines. Besides, the presence of severe inflammation and adhesions made interposition of strap muscle flap or sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) impossible. The patient was then transferred to the ICU.\nAfter this operation, secretions of the endotracheal tube reduced dramatically but increased again at the 3rd postoperative day. Unfortunately, the subsequent endoscopy showed the persistence of the fistula about 16 cm from incisors, just above the level of anastomosis (). The decision for the next neck exploration through the previous incision site was implemented 1 day later.\nAfter exploration of the neck via previous incision, rigid esophagoscopy with transillumination of the esophagus was performed to detect the fistula orifice by one surgeon and at the same time gastrotracheal fistula and anastomosic leak was sutured by another surgeon. Besides, tracheostomy was done for the patient to eliminate the endotracheal tube cuff pressure on suture lines. As mentioned previously, interposing a muscle bundle was impossible.\nThe patient was then transferred to the ICU. In the ICU, the patient condition worsened and bilious secretions from the endotracheal tube continued. A new chest X-ray showed whitish lung which was in favor of chemical pneumonitis. Blood pressure and O2 saturation dropped and finally, the patient expired the next day after the second neck exploration.

A 3 years old boy presented with history of recurrent fever, episodes of painful urination, increased frequency and haematuria for one year. He had been treated with several courses of antibiotics for urinary tract infections with temporary relief of symptoms before recurrence. At initial presentations several urine analysis using dipstics were performed at the local dispensary and reported to show features of urinary tract infections but no further work up such as urine culture, voiding cyctourethrogram or abdominal ultrasound was performed. Three months before admission to our unit, his mother had felt a mass on his left flank and an abdominal ultrasound done at the nearby District Hospital suspected Wilms' tumor and the patient was referred to our unit for further evaluation. The patient had otherwise attained his developmental mile stones as per age and had no any dysmorphic features.\nOn examination; the child was febrile with body temperature of 38.8 °C with tenderness on the left lumber region and had a palpable mass on the same side. Laboratory investigations performed are summarised in the concise table below; Table .\nA repeat abdominal ultrasound showed a left renal mass 7.4X7.1X5 cm with multiple cystic lesions. The renal pelvis was destroyed with some calcific changes but no extension to the neighboring structures were noted. The right kidney was normal in size and echogenicity.\nAbdominal CT Scan (Figs. and ) showed an enlarged left kidney measuring 7.9X6.7 cm in size with thinning of the cortices and loss of corticomedullary differentiation, foci of calcifications were also seen and the renal parenchyma was replaced with multiple septations (A). Contrast enhanced CT scans showed areas of peripheral enhancement surrounding non-enhancing cystic foci within the mass. There was no obvious filling defect seen in the renal vein or inferior vena cava. The right kidney was normal in size and shape, urinary bladder displayed normal outline and other abdominal organs were all normal.\nBased on the clinical presentation and abdominal CT scan, a clinical diagnosis of Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis was made and the patient underwent left radical nephrectomy. Intra-operatively an enlarged yellowish grey left kidney with multiple mesenteric and hilar lymph nodes was seen, radical left nephroureterectomy and hilar lymphnode resection was performed, the right kidney was normal on inspection. The resected tissues were sampled and sent for culture and sensitivity but there was no bacterial growth after 7 days. Histological studies reported macroscopically gross yellowish renal tissues microscopically showing a renal histology infiltrated with foamy lipid laden macrophages in a mixture of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis confirming a diagnosis of Xanthogralomatous pyelophritis (Fig. ).\nThe patient faired well postoperatively and was kept on a 7 days course of intravenous Tazobactam/piperacillin and discharged home 10 days post nephrectomy.

A 13-year-old girl complained of a three-month history of lower back pain and degrading ability to walk. Her past medical history revealed developmental delay with gait disorder related to premature birth at 31 weeks of gestation. On physical examination, she had mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical group, motor weakness, muscle hypotrophy, loss of sensation and brisk deep tendon reflexes at the lower extremities. Laboratory investigations detected unremarkable peripheral blood cell count, high levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (74 mm; normal up to 20 mm) and C-reactive protein (89 mg/L; normal up to 10 mg/L). A peripheral blood lymphocyte typing was negative for presence of blasts and a bone marrow aspiration allowed to exclude tumor involvement. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and the spine showed an epidural mass infiltrating the spinal canal via the left neural foramen. The mass, extending from Th12 to L1 with compression and displacement of the spinal cord (Fig. A, B), was causing destruction and collapse at the twelfth thoracic vertebra. To ascertain the disease spread and the correct risk stratification, a total body computed tomography (CT) was performed. The CT confirmed the presence and the extension of the paravertebral mass and revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and cervical groups (Fig. A, B). Staging 18F-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan detected pathological FDG uptake involving the paravertebral tumor and the lymph nodes detected at CT scan (Fig. ). The patient underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy of the epidural mass. Histological examination with immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a classic-type, nodular sclerosing variant HL, excluding both a primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma and an anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Considering both bone involvement, due to contiguity of the mass, and neurological symptoms, related to compression by tumor, the girl was classified as stage 4. After informed consent was acquired, she received 2 cycles of chemotherapy using Prednisone, Vincristine, Doxorubicin, Etoposide (OEPA regimen), followed by 4 cycles of Prednisone, Dacarbazine, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, Doxorubicin (DECOPDAC-21 regimen), according to the specific international protocol European Network-Paediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma (EuroNet-PHL-C2). During treatment there was a rapid and marked improvement of motor and sensory deficits. Total-body CT after treatment revealed a complete remission of the epidural mass, reduction in lymph node size in the mediastinum group, but no change of the cervical lymph nodes. FDG-PET scan showed an uptake only in the upper neck lymph nodes. Therefore, the patient received a total dose of 2880 cGy radiation therapy delivered to the laterocervical lymph nodes at 180 cGy per fraction over 16 days. CT-scan after radiation therapy documented complete remission.\nThe girl was required to wear an orthopedic corset for six months, following the vertebral collapse, to maintain an erect position. Intensive neuromotor rehabilitation improved strength and muscle trophism. She started walking again with assistance initially, until complete ambulatory recovery. She performed clinical and laboratory evaluation, chest x-ray and abdomen ultrasound every three months for 1 year and every four months thereafter. Three years post-treatment, she has no residual back pain or neurological sequelae. MRI acquired annually from tumor onset confirms complete remission, no relapse or complications (Fig. ).

Case 1 was a 63-year-old man who presented with a 4-month history of productive cough and started to deteriorate after having a fever for a week. The patient had an 8-year history of cigarette smoking, and his father had been diagnosed with lung cancer. Repeated antibiotic treatment had been used since he started coughing, which produced a small amount of yellow sputum, and on January 6, 2018, he was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Unfortunately, his condition did not improve, and he gradually developed persistent right chest pain and shortness of breath after activity. He was admitted to our hospital on March 19th, and chest computed tomography (CT) showed an irregular solid nodule in the anterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung and lamellar density shadows in the lower lobe of the right lung ( and ). A bronchoscopic examination showed that the bronchi were unobstructed, slightly congested and had a mild amount of purulent exudate. A transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was performed in the posterior basal segment and dorsal segment. Galactomannan (GM) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was 1.068. No fungus, interstitial fibroblastic proliferation, incrassation or fibrosis was seen in the lung tissue biopsy, but acid-fast staining and PAS negativity suggested organizing pneumonia; the patient was then diagnosed with organizing pneumonia. The patient was started on prednisone 30 mg orally once a day on March 27, and he was discharged after his symptoms of cough, chest pain and shortness of breath had gradually improved. He took prednisone as prescribed after discharge. However, his condition worsened with a fever that developed on May 8, and he was admitted to the hospital on May 15. On examination, his body temperature was 39.6°C, and his superficial lymph nodes were not swollen. A small moist rale was detected in the lower right lung. Routine blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 15.85×109/L, a red blood cell count of 4.18×1012/L, a hemoglobin level of 110.70 g/L, and a neutrophil percentage of 83.0%. His hypersensitive C-reactive protein was 171.23 mg/L, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 70 mm/h, and serum procalcitonin was 0.707 ng/mL. The serum was positive for AIGAs. His plasma HIV antibody, blood culture, beta-D-glucan, GM and Cryptococcus latex agglutination tests were all negative. The lesion in the right upper lobe was still present, and the high-density lesions in the posterior and outer basal segments of the lower lobe of the right lung were slightly smaller on May 16. A percutaneous lung biopsy was performed on May 21, 2018. The right lower lung biopsy showed a chronic inflammatory lesion but no granuloma or neoplastic lesion. Immunohistochemistry with PAS and acid-fast staining showed that the chronic inflammatory lesions were negative. After the admission of the patient and after considering an infection in the lung, the dosage of prednisone was gradually reduced and ultimately discontinued on May 24. The patient was successively treated with imipenem-cilastatin, voriconazole, compounded sulfamethoxazole and linezolid but still had a fever, with the highest temperature being 39.1°C. On May 30, his symptoms, including difficulty breathing, gradually worsened, and he developed type I respiratory failure. Therefore, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for endotracheal intubation for salvage treatment. After admission to the ICU, the patient had scattered herpes in his right anterior chest wall and posterior chest wall. Herpes zoster was clinically diagnosed, and acyclovir sustained release tablets were given as oral antiviral treatment. T. marneffei was cultured from lung biopsy tissue performed on June 4, and chest CT showed growth of the two lung lesions ( and ). Liposomal amphotericin B was started on June 6 as an antifungal agent; the patient's temperature returned to normal, and the patient's cough and shortness of breath improved after 3 days. He was transferred back to the general ward. Unfortunately, liposomal amphotericin B was discontinued due to progressive renal impairment and was replaced by voriconazole 0.2 g twice daily starting on June 19. He was discharged after a chest CT showed that the lung lesions were significantly smaller ( and ) on June 25. He was started on a course of itraconazole after discharge. He developed another episode of cough and fever with a maximum temperature of 40°C on December 25, 2020. A chest CT showed that the nodules in the right upper lobe of the lung were significantly larger and that the lesions in the lower lobes of both lungs were stable on January 15, 2019 ( and ). Bronchoscopy revealed that the mucosa in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe had lost its normal structure, and the lumen was narrow. The pathology from the TBLB performed in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe showed primary adenocarcinoma (–). The patient was confirmed to have right lung adenocarcinoma and TSM. However, he was discharged after refusing treatment and died in February 2019.

A 35-year-old female with no comorbidities and addiction came to the hospital with complaints of loose motions and pain in abdomen. She was having watery stools 8–10 times a day with nocturnal frequency of 3–4 times. It was associated with mucus in stools and tenesmus, and it persisted with fasting. Pain in abdomen was in the left lower quadrant of abdomen, intermittent, dull aching in nature and used to increase during defecation. She was also having significant loss of weight of 15 kg in 1 year. There was no similar illness in the past or family. There was no history of TB in family. Her obstetric history was normal but was having irregular menstrual period for 6 months.\nHer body mass index was 18.1 kg/m2. General and systemic examination was normal. Her complete blood count, renal function test, and liver function test were normal. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was high and measured 45 mm at 1 h. She was nonreactive for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Her chest X-ray and ultrasonography of the abdomen were normal. Inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal TB, and intra-abdominal malignancy were kept as differential diagnoses; therefore, colonoscopy and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) scan of the abdomen were planned. Her colonoscopy was done which showed a large ulceroproliferative growth with luminal narrowing in the rectum starting at 3 cm and extending up to 13 cm from anal verge []. Proximal to the growth mucosa appeared normal till cecum and terminal ileum []. CECT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed diffuse thickening of the rectum and anal canal with narrowing in the anorectum. The remaining region of the colon was normal in appearance both by colonoscopy and CECT scan. CECT scan also showed a normal ileocecal region. Screening of the chest by CT scan showed normal lung fields.\nHistopathological examination of the biopsy from the rectal growth revealed multiple epithelioid cells attempting to form granuloma. Ziehl–Neelsen staining demonstrated the presence of several acid-fast bacilli (AFB) []. Therefore, a final diagnosis of rectal TB was made, and the patient was started on standard four drugs antitubercular therapy (ATT). She responded to the treatment well and became asymptomatic after 2 months of therapy.

A 71-year-old elderly woman was admitted to Shandong Sunshine Union Hospital, Shandong, China, on November 10, 2017, due to chest tightness and breathing shortness after activity for 1 year and coughing for 2 months. The patient began to have chest tightness and breathing shortness after general physical activity 1 year ago and coughing (dry coughs mainly) 2 months ago. A small amount of white sputum was noted after a severe cough, which was heavy at night and light in the daytime. The patient was diagnosed with ""severe aortic stenosis"" using color Doppler echocardiography at several hospitals, and was admitted to the aforementioned hospital with ""severe aortic stenosis (bicuspid deformity) and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis,"" which was confirmed using transthoracic echocardiography. The patient had a history of hypertension for 10 years and usually took antihypertensive drugs to control blood pressure. The physical examination revealed a clear respiratory sound of bilateral lungs without rhonchus and moist rales and a systolic 3/6 grade murmur in the third intercostals of the left border of sternum. The liver was not enlarged and had no swelling in both lower extremities. The laboratory examination of brain natriuretic peptide was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with a maximum thickness of 20 mm, the diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract of 13 mm, and the anterior flow velocity of the aortic valve of 4.3 m/s. Cardiac MRI revealed myocardial hypertrophy, left ventricular outflow tract stenosis, aortic stenosis, and bicuspid deformity (Fig. ), indicating the requirement of aortic valve replacement and left ventricular outflow tract dredging.[ Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (Fig. ) showed aortic stenosis and left ventricular outflow tract stenosis. Surprisingly, the aortic valve was normal without stenosis or insufficiency, and the asymmetrically hypertrophic myocardium under the aortic valve caused left ventricular outflow tract stenosis. Therefore, the diagnosis was changed to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The Morrow procedure was performed to remove the hypertrophic myocardium from the left side of the middle point of the right coronary leaflet to the left coronary leaflet. After the operation, the transesophageal echocardiography examination revealed that the velocity of left ventricular outflow tract decreased to 2.6 m/s and the opening restriction of aortic valve had been corrected (Figure unreserved). Hypertrophic cardiomyocytes were found in the pathology. The conditions of left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve were observed using echocardiography in the follow-ups 6 months and 1 year after the operation.

An 85-year-old woman with a history of smoking presented with an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray, which was performed as part of a pre-operative evaluation for osteoarthritis of the knee in December 2012. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2.8 cm nodule in the right upper lung lobe (Fig ) and fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed uptake only within the nodule. Although transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) was negative, cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the right upper bronchi showed atypical cells suspicious for malignancy.\nThe patient was referred to our hospital for curative pulmonary resection in March 2013. Her physical examination was unremarkable, and her blood examination, including tumor markers, showed anemia with a hemoglobin value of 10.2 mg/dL. The cause of the anemia was not clear despite scrutiny. In April 2013, the size of the tumor shadow decreased from 2.8 to 1.8 cm (Fig ). We strongly suspected the tumor was benign rather than malignant and planned to perform a follow-up imaging examination. The tumor shadow remained unchanged for the next three months (Fig ). In July 2013, the patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and began to receive glucocorticoid treatment. In January 2014, the tumor increased from 1.8 to 4.8 cm (Fig ) and a TBLB of the tumor was performed with suspicions of inflammatory disease or malignancy; however results of the TBLB were inconclusive. A chest CT scan was repeated in June 2014 and showed that the tumor shadow had further enlarged to 8.6 cm, with swelling of the mediastinal lymph nodes and suspected invasion of the superior vena cava and chest wall (Fig ). FDG-PET showed uptake within the tumor with a maximal standard uptake value of 23.6, but did not show uptake within the mediastinal lymph nodes. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of the tumor revealed a proliferation of tumor cells with large and irregular nuclei (Fig ). We diagnosed primary lung cancer, cT4N0M0, stage IIIA, according to the TNM (tumor node metastasis) Classification of Malignant Tumors (7th edition).\nA right upper lobectomy with lymph node dissection in the hilum and right upper mediastinum was performed. Although the tumor had invaded the mediastinal fat tissue and parietal pleura, it did not invade the superior vena cava. The patient experienced a good postoperative course with no complications. On pathologic examination, the tumor was 7.5 cm in diameter and invaded the mediastinal fat tissue, but the lymph nodes did not show any evidence of metastasis. The histopathological results were similar to those from the biopsied tissue, and we diagnosed lung LCNEC, pathological stage IIIA (T4N0M0), based on immunohistochemical studies. The tumor was positive for synaptophysin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and cytokeratin 7, and was negative for chromogranin, CD56, and p63 (Fig –). The patient did not receive postoperative cytotoxic chemotherapy because of her own request and her advanced age.

We present a case of a 22-year-old African American female who presented to the emergency room with worsening respiratory distress and drooping of eyelids for the past 2 weeks. The patient had a protracted history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed at the age of 11 with resultant lupus nephritis that was initially treated with cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate, and later replaced with azathioprine and prednisone at the time of her pregnancy. Her medical history was also significant for hypothyroidism, hypertension and myasthenia gravis.\nShe was admitted to the intensive care unit with acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. She was found to be febrile (102.3 °F) with tachycardia (144 beat per minute). Physical examination was remarkable for decreased breath sounds over the left anterior hemi-thorax and chest X-ray was consistent with pneumonia. She was diagnosed as having respiratory muscle weakness secondary to myasthenia crisis, precipitated by sepsis. Emergent plasmapheresis, steroids and antimicrobial agents were initiated. Pyridostigmine therapy was not immediately instituted due to increased bronchial secretions, but was started later on as there was no improvement despite five cycles of plasmapheresis.\nOn the eighth day of her hospitalization, she became hypotensive and developed oliguria with acute renal failure likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). On the ninth day, she developed abdominal tenderness for which an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan done, showed free air in the abdominal cavity. An emergent laparotomy revealed peritonitis with gastric cardia perforation, which was repaired.\nThe patient also had worsening coagulation panel and liver function tests over the course of hospitalization. The prothrombin time (PT) which was normal at the time of admission, later increased to 18.1 s with a decrease in albumin level to 2.1 g/dL (3.2 - 4.8 g/dL). Her bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (AKP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were all normal at the time of admission (AST of 19 units/L and ALT of 16 units/L). While the alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels remained stable, the AST and ALT levels progressively worsened to AST 352 units/L and ALT 369 units/L on the ninth day of hospitalization. The cause of this fulminant hepatic failure was not clear at this time as the level of transaminitis in this patient was not as high as expected from acute viral hepatitis and the etiology was considered to be multifactorial secondary to ischemic hepatopathy and underlying sepsis.\nThe very next day, after cessation of plasmapheresis, levels of AST and ALT suddenly peaked to 1,618 and 1,018 units/L, respectively. Patient's clinical course was complicated by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequently on the 15th day of hospitalization, she had a fatal cardiac arrest.\nThe patient's cause of fulminant hepatic failure was revealed on autopsy.

A 40-year-old lady with an underlying systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis since 2002 currently under control with oral prednisolone 10 mg once daily, oral azathioprine 50 mg once daily, and oral hydroxychloroquine 250 mg twice daily presented to the emergency department with a low-grade fever and multiple episodes of vomiting and watery diarrhea for the past 3 days. There was no joint pain, no alopecia, no rash, no oral ulcers, and no heart failure symptoms. On physical examinations, she was febrile with the temperature of 38.2°C and mildly dehydrated, but otherwise comfortable, not tachypneic, and not in distress. Her blood pressure was 128/86 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 110 beats per minute. Her abdomen was soft, not tender, and no palpable organomegaly. Examination of the cardiorespiratory and neurological system was also revealed no abnormal finding. Initial blood investigation was done (as shown in Table ). Her white blood cells and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated, and there was mild hypoalbuminemia, acute kidney injury, and minimal proteinuria. She was treated as infective acute gastroenteritis with mild degree of acute kidney injury secondary to dehydration and was started on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone 2 gm once daily. She was also given four pints of IV 0.9% saline over 24 h. In view of the presence of proteinuria, early reactivation of lupus nephritis was suspected. She was given IV hydrocortisone 200 mg three times a day (total dose of 600 mg per day). The oral prednisolone was withheld, while her oral azathioprine and oral hydroxychloroquine were continued. Shortly after the first dose of IV hydrocortisone, she developed severe sinus bradycardia with the heart rate of 30–40 beats per minute. Her blood pressure was 140/70 mmHg. Electrocardiogram (ECG) which was done immediately showed sinus bradycardia with the heart rate of 30 beats per minute, partial right bundle branch blocked, and no evidence of coronary ischemia (as shown in Figure ). She was put on continuous cardiac monitoring and on 2L oxygen supply via nasal cannula. The IV hydrocortisone was withheld and was switched to IV methylprednisolone 50 mg once daily. Serial cardiac enzyme was taken, and it was not raised. Repeated ECG showed no dynamic ischemic changes with persistent sinus bradycardia. IV atropine was not given yet as she was asymptomatic and her blood pressure was stable. Echocardiography was done and showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction without any regional wall hypokinesia and dilated chambers. Her heart rate slowly improved after the withdrawal of hydrocortisone and become normal after 2 days. There was no similar complication seen with IV methylprednisolone. She was admitted for a total of 3 days. Upon discharge, her symptoms resolved, her renal function, white blood cells, and CRP level normalized, and she was prescribed with oral cefuroxime 250 mg twice daily and oral prednisolone 30 mg once daily, which were to be tapered weekly, along with oral azathioprine 50 mg once daily and oral hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily.

A 53-year-old woman first presented to our clinic as a referral for evaluation of urinary incontinence. She had a complex history, including stage four cervical cancer nine years prior that had invaded the bladder and been treated with combination brachytherapy, external beam radiation, and chemotherapy. Her urinary incontinence complaint traced back seven months and was characterized as a complete loss of bladder control. Speculum examination revealed the pooling of urine in the vaginal vault with a high suspicion for VVF. The patient did not have evidence of recurrent cervical cancer. Two weeks later, she underwent rigid cystourethroscopy with bilateral ureteral catheterization, bilateral retrograde pyelography, and vaginoscopy. The procedure showed a fistula tract on the anterior vaginal wall extending medially into the bladder just posterior to the trigone (). No evidence of upper tract obstruction was seen on retrograde pyelography. No vaginal stricture was present preventing access to the fistula. The fistula tract was biopsied and revealed no evidence for recurrence of her cervix cancer.\nDue to her prior history of pelvic radiation and morbid obesity with a BMI of 54.95 kg/m2, a vaginal approach was opted for to limit postoperative complications associated with poor wound healing. We began by inserting a 22 French rigid cystoscope with a 30-degree lens into the bladder through the urethra. Bilateral ureteral orifices were in normal position, and the large fistula tract was noted to be supratrigonal, away from the ureteral orifices. We then placed a 0.035 straight sensor wire into the left ureteral orifice up to the kidney. A 5-French Pollack catheter was passed over this wire and the procedure was repeated on the right side, providing identification of the ureters for the remainder of the procedure. Vaginoscopy was then performed, and a 0.035 straight sensor wire was passed through the fistula opening. We returned to the bladder with the cystoscope, where we grasped the distal end of the sensor wire. A 10-French silicone catheter was placed over this using a modified Seldinger technique with 10 mL in the balloon to identify the fistula tract. The setup was completed and we moved forward with the fistula repair ().\nWe began by placing 3-0 Vicryl sutures on the superior and inferior aspects of the labia majora to provide more retraction. A lone star retractor was placed with skin hooks deeper in the vagina to maximize exposure. Following exposure, vasopressin solution was injected circumferentially around the fistula and posterior vaginal wall to provide hemostasis and hydrodissection. Using a 15-blade scalpel, the anterior vagina was incised circumferentially around the fistulous tract. In the same plane, the vagina was dissected away from surrounding tissue with Metzenbaum scissors. This maneuver was repeated on the posterior aspect of the vagina. After the vaginal flaps were elevated sufficiently, we continued dissection proximally to the fistula. Once around the tract, we used 3-0 Vicryl sutures on a UR6 needle to close the mucosal edges over the fistula tract. A moderate fill test of the bladder revealed no leak. A biologic graft made of CPT was prepped with a soak time of 30 minutes and cut into 2 × 2 cm squares. With the 3-0 Vicryl on a UR6, we placed the dermis in a quilted fashion overlying the repair (). Once properly placed, we began sewing the rectovaginal fascia to the pubovesical fascia with 3-0 Vicryl on a UR6 in a tension-free fashion to obliterate the vaginal opening. We concluded by trimming and closing the vaginal mucosa, thereby finishing the colpocleisis to provide the extra layer of support (). A final moderate fill test was performed, which ensured no leak.\nThe patient presented two weeks postoperatively with a negative cystogram. The patient was seen at six months from surgery and continues to be completely dry.

A 13-year-old neutered male Labrador retriever was referred to the Radiation Oncology service for evaluation and treatment of a suborbital spindle cell sarcoma. On presentation, a 1.5 cm diameter, multilobulated mass could be appreciated intraorally at the palatal aspect of the right maxillary second molar tooth. Thoracic radiography and regional mandibular lymph node aspiration was performed prior to referral, which revealed reactive lymphoid tissue and no evidence of pulmonary metastasis or intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. Head CT revealed a 3 cm x 2 cm soft tissue attenuating mass along the right caudal maxilla extending from the distal aspect of the right maxillary second molar tooth and into the suborbital adipose tissues with enlarged and attenuating zygomatic salivary gland ().\nThe patient was referred to the Dentistry and Oromaxillofacial Surgery service for excision of the OZMC and associated musculature, oral mucosa, gingiva and dentition utilizing a combined intra- and extraoral approach with a transpalpebral exenteration. The excision extended from the furcation of the right maxillary fourth premolar tooth and extended caudally to the mid-zygoma. From dorsal to ventral, the excision extended from the inferior orbital crest of the lacrimal bone and extended into the mandibular ramus and body just ventral to the mandibular second and third molar teeth. The excision including portions of the caudal maxilla, lacrimal, frontal, palatine, zygomatic, temporal, pterygoid and mandible bones as well as the zygomatic salivary gland. The palatal extent of the excision was the median palatine raphe. Following excision, the mesial and palatal roots of the maxillary fourth premolar tooth were extracted and the wound was closed as described above.\nHistological evaluation of the resected tissue confirmed the diagnosis of spindle cell sarcoma, but could not differentiate the tumor between fibrosarcoma and nerve sheath sarcoma. Greater than 1 cm tumor free histologic margins were reported. The dog recovered uneventfully from general anesthesia without any need for blood products and was managed overnight in the CCU on hydromorphone (0.5 mg/kg q 6 h IV). Meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg SQ) and ampicillin (22 mg/kg IV) were also administered. The dog was discharged 48 h post-operatively with oral acetaminophen (11 mg/kg q 8 h), gabapentin (10 mg/kg q 8 h PO) and meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg q 24 h). Instructions to feed only canned or softened kibble and to avoid toys or mouth play were given to the owners.\nThe patient returned 2 days post-operatively and a small amount of mucoid discharge from the rostral skin incision was noted. The client was instructed to give oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (13.75 mg/kg q 12 h). At the time of oral surgery recheck and skin suture removal 14 days post-operatively the owners reported the dog was doing very well at home, eating and drinking well and was not experiencing difficulty breathing. However, occasional ""hacking"" had been observed. The extraoral closure site and the rostral extent of the oral incision was healed. However, an ~2 cm diameter area of dehiscence was noted at the caudal most extent of the intraoral closure site. The owners were advised that a definitive repair of the resultant oronasal fistula would be delayed until inflammation in all tissues had resolved. At 13 weeks post-operatively the client reported the development of a purulent draining tract on the face at the previous surgical site. Physical examination of the patient at 14 weeks post-operatively confirmed a purulent draining tract at the level of the medial canthus of the exenteration site. At 16 weeks post-operatively the patient was anesthetized for examination, which revealed communication of the facial draining tract with the previous surgery site and a concurrent oronasal fistula. Samples were taken from the draining tract for culture and sensitivity prior to thorough lavage and debridement. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue the previously prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and meloxicam pending culture and sensitivity results, which yielded moderate growth of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus pseudointermedius (MRSP). The patient was instructed to stop the prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and was provided a 2-week course of oral doxycycline (6 mg/kg q12 h) and metronidazole (10 mg/kg q12 h) as per the results of sensitivity testing. The patient presented at 23 weeks post-operatively for definitive surgery to close the oronasal fistula. An island axial pattern flap of the left hard palate was utilized to close the previously described defect. The patient was discharged with oral meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg q24 h) and gabapentin (13 mg/kg q8 h) for 14 days. The patient presented 4 weeks after revision surgery reportedly doing well at home. Oral examination confirmed healing of the previously repaired oronasal fistula site. Exposed palatal bone that was left to heal by second intention showed minor signs of granulation. Concern for inhibition of healing from the previously diagnosed MRSP was communicated to the client and the patient was restarted on the previous antibiotic regimen. The patient was reassessed by his primary care practitioner 5 weeks after revision surgery and photographs confirmed a near complete granulation bed at the open site. Follow up email contact with the client 13 weeks after revision surgery confirmed the patient was doing well at home with complete healing of the surgery site.

A 54-year-old female patient without any symptoms, admitted to our clinic because of history of CRC in her mother. There was no palpable mass on physical examination, no evidence of anemia and elevation of tumor markers in laboratory parameters. In colonoscopy, we have seen ulcerating tumor approximately 15th cm from the anal verge []. Multiple biopsies were taken and pathological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a huge mass (10 cm × 9 cm) in the pelvis and bowel wall thickening in left colon []. The wall of the cystic mass contained areas of calcification and there was a 9-mm area of calcification in the mass which is looking like an ossification area. There was no relationship to the adjacent tissues and the mass had regular margin. This pelvic mass was interpreted as a teratoma by CT scan. Gynecological evaluation with transvaginal ultrasonography showed the cystic mass did not originate from ovarium. We have made preoperative mechanical bowel cleansing and applied antibiotic prophylaxis by given 1 g cefazolin and 500 mg metronidazole intravenous. We used da Vinci® Surgical System for the robotic surgery. After induction, the patient was placed in a modified lithotomy position with the legs apart. A 12-mm trocar was placed through an incision 3-cm right and 2-cm above umbilicus after achievement of pneumoperitoneum. A 30° standard 12-mm robotic endoscope then was inserted through this trocar. The first 8-mm trocar was placed on the right spinoumbilical line at the crossing of mid-clavicular line. The second 8-mm trocar was inserted on the left spinoumbilical line at the crossing of mid-clavicular line. The third 8-mm trocar was inserted in the left upper quadrant. The 12-mm trocar was placed in the right upper quadrant for assistant port. During surgery, we deducted a rectosigmoid junction tumor, which does not exceed serosa of the bowel. In the exploration of the pelvic mass, we have seen the mass had regular margin, ıt was mobile and associated with only the left ovary []. The mass was resected with left ovary and salpinx and led out in endobag []. Robotic anterior resection was performed and colorectal anastomosis was performed as intracorporeal with 31-mm circular stapler []. There was no anastomotic leak was shown that with the air test. Intraoperative frozen section of the mass was defined as metastatic adenocarcinoma. Right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed for the possible bilateral ovarian involvement. Operation time was lasted 165 min, considering 25 min for robotic system set up. Postoperative 2nd day oral feeding was started. The postoperative 5th day the patient was discharged. Eighteen-reactive lymph nodes and one-metastatic lenf node found by as a result of pathological examination. Tumor diameter was 4-cm and there was no tumor proximal, distal, and circumferential radial margin. The tumor is advanced to subseroza layer, but had not infiltrated the serosa. The pelvic mass defined by pathology the isolated colorectal adenocarcinoma metastasis to the only left ovary.

A 68-year-old Hispanic man with ESRD initially presented to an outside urgent care clinic with a 3-day history of a painful rash over the right thorax. His examination revealed a dermatomal, vesicular eruption at the T9 dermatome consistent with zoster reactivation. He was started on oral acyclovir 800 mg five times daily. The recommended renal dosing for a patient receiving dialysis would have been 200 mg twice daily. Over the following 4 days, his family noted progressively worsening confusion. On the day of admission, the patient's son called emergency medical services due to the patient's confusion, agitation, and auditory hallucinations. Prior to this presentation, the patient had lived independently and was able to complete all activities of daily living without assistance. His past medical history included ESRD, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, anemia due to chronic renal disease, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Prior to arrival at our hospital, his medications included amlodipine 5 mg oral once daily, aspirin 81 mg oral once daily, metoprolol succinate 150 mg oral once daily, and 20 units of insulin NPH-regular 70–30% twice daily. Oral acyclovir 800 mg five times daily was the only new medication, started 4 days prior to arrival. He received outpatient dialysis three times weekly. Per the report of his family, he did not smoke or drink alcohol. His family was unaware of any family history of neurologic disorders. He was unemployed and had no recent travel exposures. He had not been previously vaccinated against VZV.\nUpon physical examination, he was agitated and oriented only to self. His vital signs upon presentation included a body temperature of 37.3 °C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 177/90 mmHg, respirations of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 L by nasal cannula. Examination of the patient's head and neck revealed no signs of trauma. His pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. His oropharyngeal examination revealed dry mucous membranes but no lesions or ulcers. His pulmonary examination result was clear to auscultation bilaterally. His cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His abdomen was nontender and without signs of guarding. His extremities were warm, and no lower extremity edema was present. His musculoskeletal examination revealed normal range of motion and no joint erythema or effusions. His skin examination revealed a right-sided rash with erythematous papules with vesicles along the T9 dermatome (see Fig. ). Upon neurologic examination, he was unable to follow commands for testing cranial nerves, strength, or coordination. His speech was dysarthric but not aphasic. He moved all extremities spontaneously and withdrew to pain. His reflexes were 3+ bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities with no clonus and a negative Babinski sign. His muscle tone was normal.\nHis laboratory studies were notable for a serum glucose level of 170 mg/dl, sodium level of 133 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen level of 43 mg/dl, creatinine level of 5.90 mg/dl, calcium level of 8.5 mg/dl, white blood cell count of 6.8 × 109 cells/L, hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dl, and platelet count of 239 × 109 cells/L. His thyroid-stimulating hormone level was 2.95 mIU/L. The result of his urine drug screen was negative, and his ethanol level was <10 mg/dl. The result of his urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.\nMRI of the patient's brain did not reveal large-territory infarct or evidence of vasculopathy. His electroencephalogram demonstrated diffuse slowing and disorganization consistent with a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, but he had no epileptic discharges. His chest x-ray did not reveal any pulmonary infiltrates or evidence of pneumonia. CSF studies showed a protein level of 85 mg/dl, glucose level of 76 mg/dl, no red blood cells, no white blood cells, and no organisms on Gram staining. His CSF PCR result was positive for VZV and negative for other common etiologies of bacterial or viral encephalitis.\nThe emergency department did not initially have access to his prior urgent care pharmacy records. Upon receiving the positive VZV CSF PCR result, he was started on intravenous acyclovir renally dosed at 5 mg/kg and was admitted to the medicine service for his acute encephalopathy. With common toxic and metabolic causes of encephalopathy ruled out in the emergency department, our primary differential diagnosis was between VZV encephalitis and AIN. Uremic encephalopathy was also included in our differential diagnosis. However, review of the outpatient dialysis records revealed adequately dosed dialysis, as evident by achieving target dialysis clearance parameters and no missed dialysis sessions, making this diagnosis unlikely. When the outside pharmacy records arrived, revealing inappropriate acyclovir dosing, AIN became the favored diagnosis. Acyclovir was stopped, and serum drug levels were sent to a reference laboratory. CSF titers for anti-VZV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG were also pending at this time.\nNephrology was consulted, and the patient underwent two 4-hour dialysis sessions on consecutive days, after which his neurologic status improved significantly. His hospital course was not complicated by other evidence of infection, electrolyte abnormalities, or hypoglycemia that could have contributed to his acute encephalopathy. By hospital day 4, he had returned to his baseline neurologic status. On hospital day 5, he had a normal neurologic examination result and was discharged to home. At follow-up 6 months later, the patient had experienced no further episodes of confusion, dysarthria, or hallucinations and was living independently. The temporal onset of hallucinations, dysarthria, and confusion after initiating acyclovir therapy combined with the rapid improvement after discontinuation of acyclovir and initiating hemodialysis made AIN the likely diagnosis.

The aortic valve was trileaflet with a vegetation on the right coronary cusp (Figure ). The mitral valve was thickened. Diastolic doming of the anterior leaflet, fixed posterior mitral leaflet with paradoxical motion and two well-formed papillary muscles were noted (Figure ). There was no aortic stenosis and grade II aortic regurgitation was noted in addition to severe infundibular and annular stenosis with confluent branch pulmonary arteries (Figure ). Non calcific severe mitral stenosis with commissural fusion and thickening of the sub-valvular apparatus was noted. The mitral valve area was 1.1 cm2. There was no mitral regurgitation. The peak and mean gradients across the valve were 36 and 21 mmHg respectively (Figure ) and the echocardiographic mitral valve score was 6/16. Blood cultures revealed Streptococcus viridans as the infecting organism. The serum antistreptolysin O titers were within reference range, C-reactive protein was positive and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated.\nA final diagnosis of TF, subacute bacterial endocarditis of the aortic valve and severe mitral stenosis, probably of rheumatic etiology, was considered. Endocarditis with aortic regurgitation added to the hemodynamic burden and the patient succumbed to infective complications during the course of stabilization.

An 18 year old woman was referred to our outpatient clinic of Endocrinology, University-Hospital of Naples Federico II because of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Blood samples showed high levels of thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies and normal calcitonin serum levels. The patient was euthyroid with normal serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) during replacement therapy with L-T4. At physical examination, a palpable nodule of ~2 cm in size was detected in the isthmus of the thyroid. There were no palpable cervical lymph-nodes. An US evaluation confirmed an isolated lesion located in the isthmus, showing an isoechoic solid nodule with smooth margins; its size was 18 × 13 × 6 mm with intra and perilesional vascularity (Figure ). Therefore, a FNA was performed and cytological results revealed a TIR3A lesion. The cytological specimen showed an increased cellularity with some microfollicular structures in the background of scant colloid (Figure ). Thus, we assessed the risk factors associated with the isolated TIR 3A nodule of our patient. According to the ATA guidelines we repeated the FNA which confirmed the same result (TIR3A). The second US (after 6 months) showed that there were no clear signs suggesting malignancy such as microcalcifications or taller than wide-shaped nodules. However, we found a small hypoechoic cranial component in the nodule with blurred margins and elastography revealed an increased stiffness in this cranial component. No nodules were detected in the contralateral lobes by US; cervical lymph nodes were normal. Among the possible risk factors, our patient referred a familial history of thyroid cancer. Her mother was submitted to total thyroidectomy for a follicular variant of PTC twenty years ago; our subsequent evaluation showed that she was disease free at the moment.\nOn this basis, we decided that a surgical treatment was indicated for our patient and assessed the risk/benefit of total thyroidectomy vs. isthmusectomy.

A 45-year-old male farmer was brought to the ER after accidental impalement of the right lower limb by a heavy rotatory tiller blade 8 h earlier. He had to be extracted with the blade in situ by separating it from the machine. He was hemodynamically stable. The curved ""J"" shaped blade had passed posteriorly through the popliteal fossa from medial to lateral with the knee in fixed flexion [Wound A-]. There was another soft-tissue muscle deep laceration on the lateral aspect of the right leg below wound-A [Wound B-]. Distal arterial pulses in the affected lower limb were slightly diminished. Toe movements and distal sensations were normal.\nX-ray right leg [] showed the blade passing through the right knee joint obliquely. CT angiogram of the right lower limb [] confirmed the fracture of the articular surface of the tibia and suggested close proximity of the right popliteal artery to the blade. However, distal flow in the popliteal artery was present.\nFor surgery, he was intubated with the impaled right leg manually supported, away from the operation table, before turning into prone position carefully. As vascular injury was a possibility, proximal and distal vascular control of the popliteal artery was obtained by separate incisions above and below the impaled blade. As the blade was both rough and curved, the skin was incised directly over the blade connecting exit and entry wounds and deepened till the blade to extract it under direct vision while protecting neurovascular structures. The vascular bundle was just deep to the blade but found intact by the release of the vascular controls . Free lying fracture fragments of the articular surface of the tibia were removed. Wounds A and B were debrided and irrigated copiously with saline. Partial wound closure was done to prevent compartment syndrome. Wound B was also left open to drain. The limb was immobilized in slight flexion at the knee. Postoperatively, the patient was heparinized for 72 h. He also received broad-spectrum antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis. The patient was discharged after partial delayed primary closure of the wound on the 7th postoperative day uneventfully.\nThe patient had to be extracted from the tiller machine with the blade in situ Delay in transport from a remote area Difficulty in anesthesia Possibility of vascular injury required vascular control before the extraction of tiller blade The rough and curved shape of the blade required modification of the surgical plan The articular surface of the tibia was fractured with multiple loose bony fragments which required removal Heavy contamination of the wounds Multispecialty care was required due to the complexity of the injury.

A 44-year old male was referred following investigation for chest pain and dyspnoea. He had no pre-existing co-morbidities. Physical examination revealed feeble femoral pulses and he was found to be hypertensive with marked differences between the upper and lower limbs (systolic blood pressure upper limb 190mmmHg, lower limb 75 mmHg, with an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.39). Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation. Assessment through angiography via the left brachial artery showed complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus. The decision was then made to proceed to a single stage surgical approach to treat both lesions.\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, arterial lines were placed in the left radial and left femoral artery. A right infraclavicular incision and a right groin incision was made this was to establish peripheral arterial cannulation access to the right axillary and right femoral artery. An 8 mm dacron graft was anastomosed to each vessel for indirect cannulation. Median sternotomy was performed to access the mediastinum and expose the heart and aorta. Following heparinisation cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established with venous return from bi-caval cannulation. The body temperature was cooled to 25 degrees Celsius. The right superior pulmonary vein was used for venting. Once the cross clamp was applied, complete cardiac arrest was achieved using Custodiol 25 ml/kg crystalloid cardioplegia via a retrograde cannula through the coronary sinus. A further top up of cardioplegia was given once the aorta was opened through direct cannulation of the coronary ostia.\nThe aortic root, valve and ascending aorta were excised. The coronary ostia were fashioned as buttons from the native aortic root. The coronary ostia were noted to be significantly displaced, with distorted anatomy due to the patient's disease process. Therefore, 8 mm dacron grafts were attached end-to-end to each ostia, with view to performing the modified Cabrol technique later following replacement of the root. The heart was then retracted in a cephalad position to access the posterior pericardium. A vertical incision was made to expose the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). An end to side anastomosis was formed with a 20 mm dacron graft to the DTA (Fig. ). This graft was then routed posterior to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and anterior to the right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV), adjacent to the right atrium (RA). Root replacement was then performed with a 25 mm biological valved-conduit, as this was favoured by the patient over a mechanical prosthesis, despite the risk of a difficult redo procedure in the future. The 8 mm dacron grafts attached to the coronary ostia were anastmosed to the root conduit as neo coronary ostia. The distal part of the valved-conduit was anastomosed to the proximal arch under selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP). Finally, an end to side anastomosis was fashioned between the 20 mm extra-cardiac graft (attached to the descending thoracic aorta) and the ascending portion of the valved-conduit. Valve-sparing root replacement was not considered in this patient due to the grossly abnormal aortic anatomy.\nFollowing rewarming and deairing the patient was successfully weaned off CPB. The bypass time was 160 min, the cross-clamp time was 120 min, and the SACP time was 40 min. Haemostasis was achieved and thereafter a routine closure of all incision sites. The patient remained in ICU for less than 48 h, and made excellent progress on the ward. Minimal anti-hypertensives were required and the patient was discharged on 8th day post operatively neurologically intact and independent. At 3 months follow up the patient underwent a repeat CTA scan which showed complete patency in the extra-anatomical graft and resolution of the collateral arterial network (Fig. ).

An 8-year-old girl, studying in second grade was brought by parents with complaints of fear of vomiting and feeling nauseated since about seven and half months. Around 20 days before the starting of symptoms, child had episode of acute and severe abdominal pain, high grade fever with 3 bouts of vomiting with nausea for a day. She was diagnosed as having acute appendicitis by a surgeon and was operated subsequently. Within around 10 days after operation, patient started having fear of similar episode of vomiting with repeated remembrance of the episode. She complained of feeling nauseated with excessive salivation and gastric regurgitation. The treating doctor did not find anything significant and was treated symptomatically. Parents were reassured about the symptoms. She started attending her classes but gradually her complaints increased. She had constant thoughts of feeling nauseated. She started eating less, avoiding outside food which she used to ask for previously. She would worry about the pungent smell of vomitus in toilet and ask mother to clean it frequently. The fear increased slowly to the extent that, she started avoiding playing with other children in a fear that they will avoid her and tease her if she vomited in front of them. She avoided school for the same reason and thought that teachers will have bad impression about her if she vomits in the classroom. Meanwhile, parents asked their close relatives to console her. But symptoms went on increasing and she started refusing to use a lift, travel in bus, going to park, market places, etc., Fear became generalized and patient started worrying that her parent may suffer vomiting, she would request parents not to go outside, not to travel in bus or use lifts. Her father was working in a different city and job required frequent traveling. She had persistent fear that he may suffer vomiting as he eats outside food and there is no one to take care of him. She would call him repeatedly on phone and ask to change his job. She also developed reduced and non-refreshing sleep with constant thoughts/worries about vomiting at night with complaints of nausea and regurgitation after having her dinner. History of occasional nocturnal enuresis was also present during this period.\nShe was referred for a psychiatric consultation. She refused separate interview of parents because of the fear that they will hide the illness from her. She elaborated all the complaints and said ""I feel nauseated even when I hear a word 'vomitus' or 'vomiting' or if I see anybody vomiting"". She elaborated the incidence when she vomited after witnessing the same in the neighborhood. Besides this, there was no history of depressive or obsessive-compulsive features or eating disorder and no symptoms suggestive of other phobias. Past history was not significant. There was significant family history and both of her parents are suffering from anxiety disorder and taking regular treatment from a psychiatrist. Birth and developmental history did not reveal any significant abnormality. She was good in academics.\nOn mental status examination, patient described her mood as anxious with appropriate affect. In thought, there was preoccupation about the worries of having nausea and vomiting along with number of questions e.g., whether I will get better; Do I have some severe illness; Will your medicines have side effect of vomiting, etc., She was diagnosed as a case of Specific Phobia of Vomiting i.e., Emetophobia.\nAs it was very difficult to involve the child in counseling or psychotherapy because of severe anxiety, she was prescribed tablet Clobazam 5 mg in divided doses and Cap Fluoxetine 10 mg. She was admitted to a child unit to reassure her as she was not willing to take medicines due to fear of side effects. After a week, she and her parents perceived mild improvement in anxiety and she was somewhat comfortable. On further follow-up, child was taught relaxation and started on Graded Exposure therapy along with the medications. She was exposed to the materials or activities related to vomiting. First, she was asked to read hand written article which contained the word 'vomitus/vomiting' (multiple times) as many times as possible. After about a week, she was asked to witness the action of vomiting by parents which they were pretending, followed by behavior as if vomiting has caused no trouble and anyone can suffer it for a short duration. After around 15 days, she was advised to attend school with a facility to go to rest room whenever she has thoughts of vomiting followed by feeling of nausea. She used the rest room only for initial 2 days after which she was as regular to the classes as before the start of illness. She was asked to play with other children only for 15 minutes to begin with. This time was increased slowly from 15 minutes to 1 hour. When she didn't have even a single vomiting during this period, she started accepting the fact that it was an irrational fear and that she can achieve a mastery over it. Slowly, she was exposed to the activities that can induce vomiting like smelling the toilet, spinning around, etc., She had nausea and she hesitated to do it initially, but with intermittent counseling and relaxation and frequently doing above activities, she could face the feeling of nausea with less fear than before. In view of severity of symptoms and family history of anxiety disorders in parents, patient was advised to continue medications.

A 66-year-old man, who complained of upper abdominal pain, was found to have EGJ tumor by endoscopy (Fig. ). He was diagnosed as having Siewert type II adenocarcinoma (E=G, cT1b, cN0, cM0, cStage I) []. We planned to perform lower esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy with double tract reconstruction.\nIn the computed tomography (CT) scan before surgery, a 10-mm aneurysm in the middle third of the splenic artery was found (Fig. ). Due to the anatomical location of the aneurysm, endovascular treatment was not considered due to recanalization and coil migration. The size of the aneurysm was not a high risk of rupture [], but we concerned about the possibility of SAA rupture due to postoperative pancreatic fistula (PF) associated with suprapancreatic lymph node dissection such as station 11p and 11d. We thought that spleen blood flow could be preserved even after SAA resection by preoperative CT scan and unnecessary invasive procedures could be avoided by simultaneous surgery. However, during simultaneous proximal gastrectomy and SAA resections, it was not clear whether there was sufficient blood supply to the spleen. Thus, we performed the surgery with a minimally invasive abdominal and left thoracic approach (MALTA) while continuously examining for the presence of blood supply to the spleen using fluorescence imaging.\nThe patient was placed under general anesthesia and was positioned in reverse Trendelenburg with the left side of the upper body lifted and the legs spread. Laparo- and thoracoscopic proximal gastrectomy and lower esophagectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and double tract reconstruction were performed. First, we resected the SAA. Next, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy was performed using five ports. Four ports were inserted into the thoracic cavity through the 9th, 10th (× 2), and 11th intercostal spaces, with the patient in the same body position. Lower thoracoscopic esophagectomy and lymph node dissection of the lower mediastinum was performed under artificial pneumothorax. The lower esophagus was resected under the thoracoscopic view to ensure an adequate margin. SAA located at the distal side of the branch of the great pancreatic artery (Fig. ), so we clamped the splenic artery to preserve the great pancreatic artery temporally. Then, we injected 5 mg of indocyanine green (ICG) intravenously to the patient. Blood supply to the spleen was confirmed using fluorescence imaging (Fig. ). Therefore, we resected the SAA without splenectomy (preserving the great pancreatic artery and the spleen). Intrathoracic esophagojejunostomy was performed with a transoral anvil (OrVil™) and a circular stapler (EEA25™) using the laparo- and thoracoscopic techniques. In addition, an oblique jejunogastrostomy for double tract reconstruction was performed. The operative time was 362 min, and there was no blood loss.\nHistopathological diagnosis of the tumor was adenocarcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation (pTIb, pN1, pStage IIB according to the UICC Classification, 8th edition,) and with clear margins. Oral intake was resumed on postoperative day 5. Postoperative CT scan revealed the preservation of the great pancreatic artery and omental branches of the left gastroepiploic artery (Fig. ). There was no splenic abscess due to ischemia or other complications. The patient's length of hospital stay was about a month.

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation. She had multiple hospital admission due to urinary tract infection and left hip pain due to fracture status post open reduction and internal fixation three months before that presented to the emergency department with acute on chronic left hip pain. Patient's pain started two weeks ago, and she described it as severe, sharp, constant, radiated to the left thigh, that has been progressively worse to the point that she has been unable to walk; nothing had made the pain better. On exam, she had an externally rotated left lower extremity, tender, cold to palpation, along with a 3-cm decubitus ulcer around the heel.\nInitial laboratory workup showed elevated potassium of 7.2, creatinine at 13.34 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 103, initial white blood cell counts 51,200/mcl, platelet 585, lactic acid 7.2, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 97 and C-reactive protein 23. Her electrocardiogram was significant for generalized hyperacute T wave. Given electrolytes abnormalities, a non-tunneled central line catheter was placed for urgent hemodialysis. Before this was able to be done the patient became hypotensive and tachycardic, not responsive to aggressive intravenous fluids resuscitation, requiring initiation of vasopressors. She was taken to the intensive care unit and started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric coverage. Additional tests result included a positive urine culture for Escherichia coli along with blood cultures showing Gram-positive rods.\nAt the time of admission, the primary diagnosis was septic shock secondary to urinary tract infection with suspected blood culture contamination. Further workup included left hip arthroscopy to identify another source of infection due to severe persistent left hip pain and lack of improvement in her overall clinical status, but it was unable to yield synovial fluid. Repeated blood cultures showed no growth for which the urinary tract was suspected to be the primary source of infection. Antibiotics were tailored based on susceptibilities of the urine culture and were changed to Ceftriaxone (Table ). Nonetheless, her admission was complicated by acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, as well as the addition of multiple vasopressors.\nIt was not until the third day of hospitalization when the initial blood cultures finalized as Clostridium perfringens (Table ). Due to the lack of improvement and recent blood cultures results, antibiotics were changed again to piperacillin-tazobactam, and the infectious disease specialist was consulted. Recommendations were made to add clindamycin, considering computed tomography (CT) of the hip/pelvis and lumbar spine. We decided to wait for the final susceptibilities report to discuss surgical exploration of the left hip since it was unable to be determined this as the source of primary infection. Despite the latest measurements, the patient continued getting hypotensive and progressed to multiorgan failure resulting in death by the end of the third day.

A 52-year-old man presented to our hospital with decreased vision in both eyes due to ocular chemical burns (lime) in 2018. He had undergone lamellar keratoplasty in the left eye 2 years prior. On examination, his visual acuity (VA) in both eyes was hand motions with accurate light perception. Slit-lamp examination revealed total corneal opacification with pannus in the right eye. The left eye showed a failed large lamellar corneal button with 360° corneal vascularization. No underlying anterior chamber details were visualized. Anterior segment ultrasound (ultrasound biomicroscopy, UBM) revealed an eye with a shallow anterior chamber depth and 180° peripheral anterior synechiae. IOP estimated by digital palpation was in the normal range. Ultrasound imaging showed no obvious optic nerve cupping. After discussion with the patient, it was decided to proceed with KPro placement in the left eye in March 2018. His cataract was removed at the time of surgery by anterior vitrectomy, and an aphakic KPro was placed. At postoperative week 4, he had 10/100 vision with a cup disc ratio of 0.5 (Fig. a). At month 2, he started to develop glaucoma de novo, with a decrease in vision to counting fingers (FC) at 2 m. His IOP was uncontrolled with topical and systemic anti-glaucoma medication, and he therefore had an AGV placement approximately 3 months after the KPro implantation. The shunt tube was introduced into the anterior chamber through a tract created by a 23-gauge syringe needle. The tip of the tube is long enough to be seen through the KPro optic. At postoperative day 1, the patient's IOP was 35 mmHg, estimated by digital palpation, and the tip of the tube was found to be embedded in the residual lens capsule (Fig. b). This situation was managed with one Nd:YAG laser pulse of 1.5 mJ to the membrane at the tube tip, which ruptured the membrane (Fig. c). The membrane retracted posteriorly, and the IOP dropped to 15 mmHg, estimated by palpation. Topical steroids were used to control the mild postoperative inflammation. To date, the IOP has remained low for 7 months. At the last follow-up, his visual acuity was FC at 1 inch with a cup disc ratio of 0.9 (Fig. d).

A 62-year-old man who had 15 years earlier undergone partial resection for left sphenoorbital meningioma in another hospital presented with a 1-year history of progressive proptosis of the left eye. He was referred to our hospital because magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) revealed a hyperostotic tumor of the left sphenoid wing with orbital and middle fossa extension. On admission, ophthalmic examination showed slight proptosis of the left eye, but visual acuities, visual field areas, eye movements, and pupillary light reflexes remained normal. Neurological examination showed no neurological deficits. The results of laboratory examinations, including thyroid function, were essentially normal. CT performed in our hospital revealed hypertrophy of the left sphenoid wing, orbital lateral wall, and floor of the middle fossa [Figure and ]. MRI showed a Gd-enhancing tumor occupying the left sphenoid wing and orbital lateral wall []. Extension of the tumor into extracranial structures such as the sphenoid sinus, pterygopalatine fossa, and infratemporal fossa as well as adjacent structures such as the cavernous sinus and SOF was also revealed [Figure and ]. Cerebral angiography demonstrated hypervascularity of the tumor supplied by the branches of the internal maxillary artery []. Although detailed information about the previous operation was unavailable, including histopathological examinations and surgical procedures, the radiological findings were compatible with gross extension of recurrent sphenoorbital meningioma. Preoperative embolization using N-butyl cyanoacrylate was performed 1 day before the surgical resection []. Based on MRI findings of tumor extension into the sphenoid sinus from the middle fossa with broad continuity, surgical resection through combined simultaneous transcranial and endoscopic endonasal approaches was planned for aggressive surgical resection with minimized risk of postoperative CSF leakage. Subtotal resection was performed, leaving residual tumor in the cavernous sinus and SOF. Postoperative CT showed extensively drilled skull base bone [Figure –]. Postoperative neurological examination revealed no neurological deficits, including ocular movement and facial sensation. A lumbar spinal drain was placed for 5 days postoperatively and no CSF rhinorrhea developed. Histopathological examination identified the tumor as meningothelial meningioma, World Health Organization grade I. Follow-up MRI at 3 months postoperatively demonstrated residual tumor only in the cavernous sinus and SOF [Figure –].\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine with the head fixed in a Mayfield clamp and rotated 30° to the right. To achieve both transcranial and endoscopic endonasal approaches, two surgical teams worked simultaneously. The transcranial surgeon stood at the head end of the patient and the endonasal surgeon stood on the right side of the patient.\nThe frontotemporal craniotomy made 15 years earlier was used and an additional zygomatic osteotomy was created to approach the tumor. The thickened hyperostotic sphenoid wing and lateral wall of the orbit were completely drilled out and removed. After cutting of the meningo-orbital band followed by peeling of the dura propria of the middle fossa from the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, further drilling around the SOF and floor of the middle fossa was performed. Following identification of the maxillary and mandibular nerves, the floor of the middle fossa around the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale was drilled until the pterygopalatine fossa and infratemporal fossa were exposed. During these procedures, the tumor mass extending into the sphenoid sinus was exposed and the sphenoid sinus was then widely opened by resection of the tumor mass []. All skull base bone infiltrated by the tumor was extensively drilled out and removed. Tumor-involved dura was resected and repaired with a free graft of fascia lata. Tumor extension into the cavernous sinus and SOF was left in place to avoid the risk of postoperative ocular nerve palsies. The large bone defect of the sphenoid sinus was covered with a free graft of fascia lata and then fixed with fibrin glue from the transcranial side [].\nA rigid high-definition endoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was used in a standard endonasal approach to expose the sphenoid sinus. A pedicled NSF was then prepared while maintaining the vascular supply from the posterior septal branch of the sphenopalatine artery.[] Because the tumor had expanded laterally along with development of the lateral recess of sphenoid sinus beyond the sphenoid body into the greater wing [], the transmaxillary transpterygoid approach was employed to approach the tumor extending laterally over the vidian canal.[] Uncinectomy, ethmoidectomy, and sphenoidotomy were performed in a stepwise manner. After the vidian nerve and artery were coagulated and sectioned, the contents of the pterygopalatine fossa were subperiosteally dissected and retracted laterally enough to expose the foramen rotundum. Tumor expanding laterally in the sphenoid sinus was then removed en bloc []. After resection of the tumor from the transcranial approach, the large skull base defect between the middle fossa and sphenoid sinus was covered with a pedicled NSF and then fixed with fibrin glue []. The NSF was secured with placed Surgicel®, then buttressed by gauze packing in the sphenoid sinus.

A 46-year-old otherwise healthy female presented to the clinic with complaints of progressive breast enlargement and pain over the past 3 months. Specifically, she described a more pronounced acutely developing enlargement of the right breast when compared to the left, associated with worsening discomfort and pain. Of note, the patient underwent bilateral augmentation mammoplasty using PAAG injections in China 18 years ago. She denied other associated symptoms such as fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or nipple discharge, as well as any new palpable breast masses or previous trauma to the breasts.\nOn physical examination, she was afebrile and well-appearing with stable vital signs. The patient had significant breast asymmetry, with the right breast markedly larger than left, as well as associated tenderness to palpation, enlargement of nipple areolar complex and presence of dilated superficial veins (). The right breast was noted to be more erythematous and warmer to touch when compared to the left. There were no palpable breast masses, axillary lymphadenopathy or inversion of the nipples.\nDiagnostic work up included mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of bilateral breasts. Mammography demonstrated presence of breast implants with extensive fibrous capsule discontinuity, suspicious for foci of intracapsular rupture that were more pronounced on the right. There was an air-fluid level within the implant of the right breast, representative of an extracapsular rupture which likely accounted for the size discrepancy between the breasts. MRI demonstrated diffuse nodular thickening of both capsules surrounding the PAAG implants, which was associated with mural nodules with nonvascularized finger-like projections ranging in size from 3 mm to 1.4 cm. Although these findings were benign, the patients acute breast enlargement, pain and evidence of extracapsular rupture with extravasation warranted surgical management.\nThe decision was made to proceed with removal of polyacrylamide containing capsules followed by immediate breast reconstruction. Wide inframammary fold incisions were used for completion of nipple-sparing mastectomy and en bloc capsulectomy in order to remove PAAG containing breast capsules as completely as possible. Copious wound irrigation using pulse lavage was performed to minimize presence of polyacrylamide particles. Intraoperative findings demonstrated bilateral breast capsules that had extensive fibrotic scar tissue and were filled with large amounts of porridge-like PAAG with moderate, diffuse infiltration into breast tissue (). The capsules were subsequently sent for pathological analysis.\nThe patient underwent immediate breast reconstruction using prepectoral tissue expander placement utilizing two subcutaneous drains per breast. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative Day 1.\nGross pathologic examination of breast specimens demonstrated presence of pink-tan colored membranous tissue, consistent with fibrotic capsular tissue intermixed with polymers of polyacrylamide. Microscopic examination demonstrated presence of benign breast tissue with fibrosis, foreign body giant cells and chronic inflammatory cells. There was extensive purple, gelatin-like material which represented the presence of polyacrylamide hydrogel ().

A 61-year-old female presented with Gustilo-Anderson Grade 3C compound fractures of the distal femur and Shatzker five tibial plateau fracture. She underwent initial debridement and a spanning external fixator in the acute setting and subsequently definitive fixation with a retrograde femoral intramedullary nail and lateral and posteromedial proximal tibia plates, with a bipedicled gastrocnemius flap and split skin grafts inset over the large skin defect in the same setting. The healing was complicated by tibia plateau fracture and she underwent a planned bone grafting 3 months later.\nBone union was achieved at 5 months post operatively, but the knee range of motion was limited from 5 to 20 degrees as shown in . Aggressive physiotherapy was commenced but failed to improve the range of motion. A Judet quadricepsplasty and removal of implants was subsequently performed 12 months after the initial surgery and 9 months after the secondary bone grafting surgery.\nThe anaesthetic team inserted an epidural catheter for continuous epidural anaesthesia prior to surgery and was retained in situ for the first week. Intravenous Cefazolin was given 1 hour prior to initiation of surgery and continued on for 24 hours. In supine position under general anaesthesia, the leg was cleaned and draped above the level of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the foot. A sterile tourniquet is applied and the initial skin incisions are marked out; along the lateral intermuscular septum to the lateral aspect of the patellar tendon and a medial parapatellar S-shaped incision as depicted in and .\nThe lateral incision was made first directly through the skin, fascia and muscle preserving the inter-connective tissue between the fascia and the skin to preserve dermal blood supply. The knee joint was entered via a lateral parapatellar capsular incision and the intra-articular adhesions between the femoral condyles, tibia and patella were released.\nA medial parapatellar approach was then utilized for adhesiolysis of the medial aspect of the knee. A simultaneous partial release of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and medial capsule was performed. Under radiological guidance, the posteromedial tibial plate was removed to prevent possible impingement during flexion. At this point of time, the knee was ranged and flexion had improved to 60 degrees as shown in .\nThe tourniquet was then removed and the lateral incision was then extended to the level of the Greater Trochanter. The rectus femoris origin was released at its origin via the same lateral incision, a modification of the original Judet's procedure.\nThe quadriceps muscle slide was then performed by elevating the quadriceps muscle off the femur along the intramuscular septum using an extra-periosteal approach as shown in . Careful cauterization and ligation of the perforating vessels was performed at this juncture to prevent significant blood loss.\nFractional lengthening of the fascia lata and anterior fascia of the thigh was then performed by making multiple transverse incisions at multiple levels. The intramedullary femoral nail was then removed. At this point, maximal knee flexion of 0 to 120 degrees was achieved as shown in . The medial and lateral incision's subcutaneous tissue and skin were then closed over vacuum drains with the capsule intentionally left open to prevent recurrent capsular adhesion formation.\nAn epidural catheter provided analgesic relief for 5 days post-surgery before gradually being weaned off and converted to oral analgesia.\nContinuous Passive Motion (CPM) was initiated in the postoperative care unit and continued for 24 hours for the first week. Electric muscle stimulation of the quadriceps muscles, aggressive physical therapy and cycling exercises were started on the 3rd post-operative day and the patient was allowed to ambulate on the 6th day post-surgery, after the epidural catheter had been removed.\nHer drains were removed on post op day 4 and 5 when the drainage amount was minimal. Regular monitoring of her haemoglobin levels showed a drop of 1.0 g/dL on the first post-operative day requiring blood transfusion. The haemoglobin levels were subsequently maintained.\nRemoval of sutures was performed at 3 weeks where the wounds had healed well and there was no evidence of dehiscence or skin edge necrosis. At 3 months follow up, the patient was able to ambulate and had knee range of motion from 0 to 90 degrees without extension lag as seen in . This represented an increase in range of motion of 75 degrees and the patient was able to climb stairs and return to daily activities.

A 72 year old male Caucasian patient was referred to our unit with a metastatic bony deposit involving his left proximal femur from a known primary prostatic carcinoma. Commonly, prostatic metastases are sclerotic in nature. However detailed radiological evaluation demonstrated a large lytic lesion in this case (Figure ). Due to the high risk of an impending pathological fracture, the decision was taken to perform prophylactic intramedullary nailing of the left femur (Figure ). In order to reduce the increased intramedullary pressure during nail insertion, venting of the distal end of the femur was performed (Figure ).\nThe patient did not have any other significant past medical history and he was not known to be allergic to any medication. He had surgical procedures for other conditions in the past requiring general anaesthesia and had an uneventful recovery in every case.\nDuring the procedure, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest. Fat embolism was initially thought to be the cause of this event due to the increased intramedullary pressure during reaming and nail insertion. Following successful resuscitation, a marked generalized erythematous rash was noticed which lasted for about thirty minutes. This raised the concern of a possible hypersensitivity reaction to one of the anaesthetic agents. Our patient received in total eight different drugs namely propofol, atracurium, morphine, ondansentron, dexamethasone, gelofusine, paracetamol and diclofenac. Interestingly, it was noted that the cardiac arrest occurred following a dose of atracurium and an infusion of gelofusine. Consequently, it was thought that either one of those two agents could have been responsible for the anaphylactic response.\nSerum mast cell tryptase levels taken one hour following the event, demonstrated a level of 190 ng/ml, which dropped to 60 ng/ml upon repeating the levels twelve hours later (normal range 3–23 ng/ml). The raised levels of mast cell tryptase were consistent with mast cell degranulation. The latter strongly suggested a hypersensitivity reaction. Furthermore, allergy skin prick tests were performed to all the drugs used during the procedure. Interestingly, they showed a positive reaction to gelofusine only, confirming it as the causative agent.

A 57-year-old woman presented with chronic temporal headache and right tinnitus, and the symptoms gradually aggravated. Conservative treatment continued at the local Otolaryngology Clinic based on a diagnosis of otitis media. Slight consciousness disturbance, slight fever and auditory disturbance were noted 1 year after the initial symptoms, and the patient was referred to our department. Neurological findings showed slight consciousness disturbance, and an audiometric hearing test demonstrated 30 dB in the right ear, diagnosed as a mild hearing impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed edematous brain swelling in the right temporal lobe and right tentorium and dural enhancement around the transverse sinus (fig. ). Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated occlusion of the right transverse sinus (fig. ). No marked venous cortical reflux was shown. MRI showed a heterogeneous mass lesion in the right middle ear and mastoid air cells with dural enhancement around the lesion (fig. ). She was diagnosed with recalcitrant otitis media invading the mastoid associated with transverse sinus thrombosis and was treated with antibiotics, hyperosmotic fluids, steroids and repeated external drainage of the middle ear. Consciousness disturbance gradually improved. Symptoms of temporal headache, auditory disturbance, slight fever and radiological findings of brain swelling did not disappear, and remission and exacerbation of these symptoms occurred repeatedly.\nConsciousness disturbance occurred again, and chronic temporal headache gradually aggravated 5 years after the first examination in our department. MRI revealed enlargement of the edematous swelling around the right transverse sinus, and the enhanced lesion was also enlarged (fig. ). Open drainage of the middle ear with mastoidectomy was performed 6 years after the initial symptoms. Granulation had invaded the eardrum and stapes, and the auditory tube was also filled with granulation (fig. ). Infectious granulation was removed and a tumorous lesion was detected. Pathological examination demonstrated diffuse proliferation, predominantly consisting of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with slightly irregular nuclei (fig. ), which were positive for CD20, CD79 and bcl-2, suggesting malignant lymphoma, B-cell type, classified as extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Computed tomography and blood and bone marrow evaluation did not show other lesions of malignant lymphoma, suggesting that the otitis media lesion was the primary lesion. She was treated with RCHOP (rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) chemotherapy. Symptoms improved markedly and there has been no recurrence for 4 years.

We discuss a 59-year-old female who presented for planned PICC insertion for chemotherapy administration. Her medical history consisted of sigmoid adenocarcinoma with a Hartmann's procedure the month before and subsequently commencing chemotherapy a week before. She was a non-smoker and had no familial history of coagulation disorders.\nThe PICC line was inserted into the right arm under ultrasound guidance, without any immediate concerns noted during the procedure. An X-ray revealed the PICC tip to be in a satisfactory position, but potentially a little too deep (). There were no symptoms of chest discomfort or palpitations.\nApproximately an hour later, she developed symptoms of pain and weakness to her left arm (the opposite side). Her arm was clinically assessed as cool to touch with a delayed capillary refill with pulses absent. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of her left arm was arranged which revealed an abrupt stop in the left axillary artery ( and ) with reconstitution of the vessels in the antecubital fossa. She was taken to theatre for a brachial embolectomy to re-establish blood flow to her acutely ischaemic arm.\nBrachial access was obtained over the antecubital fossa, the brachial artery was controlled and incised. Proximal embolectomy with balloon catheter retrieved a long segment of thrombus, with resulting good inflow and back bleeding. Post-operatively she was commenced on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\nShe was subsequently worked up for a cause for this limb threatening pathology. Echocardiogram revealed unremarkable cardiac valves without evidence of an embolic source. A bubble study was also performed which showed no evidence of right to left shunt or patent foramen ovale. Histology confirmed recent blood clot without organization. At follow up she had a good radial pulse and her LMWH was switched to rivaroxaban.\nPICC lines are generally considered safe, with delayed complications including occlusion, accidental withdrawal, infection and thrombotic complications []. Immediate complications are well documented, including those of a cardiac nature due to the tip in contact with the right atrium; atrial or ventricular contractions leading to atrial fibrillation (AF), supraventricular tachycardia or cardiac arrest [].\nIt has been reported that PICC line insertion can affect the right atrium and result in AF, and cease when the PICC tip is retracted [, ]. X-ray has been suggested as the gold standard for post procedural check, but this only gives an anatomical estimate of positioning rather than functional—it has therefore been suggested that electrocardiogram (ECG)-assisted placement is performed to assess for arrhythmias such as AF []. Stroke is the most widely documented risk of AF with the left atrial appendage also being affected and therefore allowing for embolic propagation from the left heart into the arterial circulation []. It should however be noted that other arterial embolization, although only accounting for <10–12% of events, can be just as devastating [, ].\nOur case suggests a subclinical episode of AF from PICC line insertion which resulted development of thrombus. This propagated to the left arm causing an acutely ischaemic limb. The rapid succession of events leading to this is of most interest. Of course there are pre-existing risk factors in our patient that predisposes her to being hypercoagulable (recent surgery and cancer diagnosis). It is likely that these factors all contributed to her overall hypercoagulable status, in addition to the likely arrhythmia acting as a trigger. Unfortunately no post procedural ECG was obtained to confirm AF and our suggestion is of course speculative. No other cause was found on investigatory work-up.\nRight arm venous access resulting in left arm arterial embolism can only be explained by an event affecting both cardiac atria. The right arm sustained no complications and working PICC line would confirm correct entry along the venous system. The possibility of right to left shunt was excluded on investigation as this would cause embolism propagation from the left atrium to the arterial system. Without a physical defect electrical conduction across the cardiac septum is a possible explanation. It is known that an electric connection exists, starting with the PICC triggering arrhythmia in the right atrium and electrical conduction propagating from there to the left atrium via the coronary sinus musculature connection []. Although arrhythmias can communicate between atria, this eliminates the need for a thrombus to develop in the right atria and travel through the lung filter. It is more likely that the thrombus origin is in the left atrium.

He was apyretic, hemodynamically stable, eupneic with good peripheral oxygen saturations, flat, and pulsating fontanelle. He had normal blood and urinary laboratory tests. No signs of traumatic brain injury were seen. Fifteen minutes after admission, he suffered another seizure. A postictal period with no reaction to pain, bradycardia, and a hard and bulging fontanelle was noticed. A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed ().\nThe patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit, and treatment with phenytoin 15 mg 12/12 h, mannitol, sedoanalgesia with midazolam, and fentanyl was started. He was intubated and connected to mechanical ventilation. An external ventricular drain was urgently placed through the left external angle of the anterior fontanelle.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) were performed in the first 24 hours after the hemorrhage (). A suprasellar lesion with 26 mm diameter compatible with a giant aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery complex was documented. A slight filling of the suspected aneurysm and an endoluminal thrombus were visualized.\nA diagnostic cerebral angiography () was done three days after MRI and MRA. No therapeutic endovascular procedure was performed once there was no filling of the suspected aneurysm, at this point. A spontaneous thrombosis was assumed to have occurred. No other lesions were identified.\nThese features were considered to be consistent with an intracranial hemorrhage secondary to the rupture of an anterior communicating artery complex giant aneurysm, with subsequent spontaneous thrombosis.\nOn the 5th day of treatment, assisted ventilation and sedation were suspended and the patient was extubated. A CT scan was repeated 11 days after the initial hemorrhage, which demonstrated persistence of the hydrocephalus. A medium-low pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunt was surgically inserted at that time.\nWith two weeks of treatment the electroencephalogram reported low paroxysmal activity, bilaterally, on the parietal region. Progressive phenytoin suspension and its substitution for carbamazepine were endeavored. The MRA was repeated at this point ().\nAt this early stage a clinically significant improvement was achieved. The child recovered to his baseline neurological condition and had no more seizures. After 26 days of hospitalization, he was discharged from hospital, without neurological deficits.\nThe patient was followed up in neuropediatric and pediatric neurosurgery outpatient clinic. He totally recovered and repeated the MRA when he was 6-month old, which disclosed further volume reduction of the thrombosed aneurysm and good cerebral vascularization (). No neurological symptoms due to mass effect were detected.\nFurther angiographic studies were performed at 6 and 12 months and subsequently with yearly intervals until 5 years after aneurysm rupture. The last MRA showed no recanalization of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm and a permeable right ACA (). At five-year follow-up, the child remains neurologically intact, living without restrictions. Seizures ceased, allowing the suspension of the prescribed medical therapy.

A 10-year-old, 35 kg, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I girl was scheduled for outpatient foot surgery. Her past medical and surgical history was unremarkable.\nAfter premedication with midazolam 10 mg per oral, an uneventful induction of anesthesia was performed with sevoflurane, followed by placement of an intravenous (IV) line. Propofol 30 mg and alfentanil 0.125 mg were given to facilitate the placement of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. IV medications administered during the 60 minute procedure included: fentanyl 0.01 mg, morphine 4 mg, ketorolac 15 mg and dexamethasone 4 mg. At the completion of surgery, the surgeon infiltrated the operative site with 4mL of 0.5% ropivicaine. Emergence from anesthesia was uneventful. The patient was transported to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), where she recovered quickly. After about 45 minutes in the PACU, the patient was returned to the same day surgery unit where she received acetaminophen with codeine for pain control. Approximately two hours after emergence from anesthesia, the patient complained of nausea and ondansetron 3 mg was administered IV. Approximately 30 minutes later she started having jerking movements of her arms and torso every time she would drift off to sleep.

A 94-year-old female was admitted to our hospital after she fell and sustained an anterior pelvic ring fracture (Figure ). She was hospitalized for mobilization. Over the past 18 years she had been treated with anticoagulation therapy with marcumar due to atrial fibrillation, 13 years ago subsequently a cardiac pacemaker was implanted. In the first days in hospital mobilisation was painful but with a walker possible. In the early morning of the fourth day after admission she developed severe pain in the thigh. Clinically the thigh was swollen but the foot pulses were well palpable. Because of persisting severe pain and the suspicion of a deep vein thrombosis a CT-scan of the thigh and the pelvis was performed. In the further course the patient complained of a partial loss of sensation of her left leg and weakness of her shank muscles, following the innervation area of the ishiadic nerve. The CT-scan showed an extensive haematoma expanding abroad the adductor muscles in the medial compartment and in the posterior compartment (Figure &). The compartment of the M. rectus femoris was not involved. Immediate surgery was performed with a complete decompression of the compartments of the thigh as well as the draining of the haematoma and wound covering with epigard (Othomed, Vienna, Austria) (Figure &). On the second postoperative day a revision for draining of the refilled haematoma was performed. Finally five days after the initial treatment during the second revision complete skin-closure was performed strainless. In the postoperative course the patient recovered quickly and the sensomotor deficits resolved completely however she developed partial skin necrosis along the approach in particular in the popliteal fossa. Subsequently these necrosis were resected and the skin was closed again strainless. Only in the popliteal foassa a skin graft from the ipsilateral posterior thigh was needed. The skin graft healed. In the further course of the hospital stay the patient again recovered quickly and was mobilized under physiotherapy control. Fifty-seven days after the initial trauma the patient was dismissed and transferred to rehabilitation center for further mobilization. At the latest follow up one year post operatively the patient is mobile with full weight-bearing and regular soft tissue condition.\nA full-blown compartment syndrome in the thigh is a rare clinical occurrence. This is mainly due to the fact that the three muscle compartments (Figure ) in the thigh can compensate much higher volumes than the four compartments below the knee []. Not only the fascia seems to be more dilative also the thigh compartments are partly open to the pelvis explaining the higher compensation rate for increasing intracompartmental volume [,]. The small number of occurring cases makes scientific randomized prospective studies with bigger numbers difficult. However the spectrum of reported cases with different etiologies is wide: Deep venous thrombosis [], vein catheriztion [], vessel aneurysm [] the complete spectrum of femoral fractures [], total hip and knee replacement surgery, intramedullary nailing [,], gunshot and stab wounds [], sport trauma [,,-], traffic accidents [,,], external compression of the thigh [,], crush injuries [,], as well as severe blunt tissue trauma []. Mithoefer [] declares that in 46% of the cases a traffic accident is the cause for a thigh compartment syndrome. Holbein [] proclaims that regarding the literature the femur fracture is the most common cause for a thigh compartment syndrome. Kladny [] numbers this risk with 1-2%. An open fracture or wound will not safely secure the leg from a compartment syndrome [,]. Multiple trauma patients seem to have a higher risk to develope a compartment syndrome because of the concurrence of different clinical conditions. High-energy blunt trauma, external compression, systemic hypotension, vascular injury, and coagulopathy in those patients may assimilate and thus lead to a compartment syndrome []. According to Schwartz a patient with an isolated injury to the thigh without any of the above mentioned risk factors has therefore a lower risk for the development of a compartment syndrome [].\nIn cases were the patient is unconscious at the intensive care unit a compartment syndrome can stay unrecognized possibly causing devastating outcome [], as the patient can not express main symptoms like disproportional pain, paraesthesia or even paralysis. Only the palpatoric tension of the affected muscle is detectable. These cases must be taken into special account and the measurement of the compartment pressure has an important role in those cases for the diagnostic. Regarding the common literature addressing this topic the measurement of the intracompartmental pressure is the gold standard for the diagnosis []. However the reliability of these measurements is questionable, as especially in multiple traumatized patients the systolic blood pressure supported by catecholamines can pretend a stable hemodynamic situation neglecting a possibly severe disregulated microcirculation []. In addition there is no consensus in the literature about a specific intracompartmental point pressure or a rule regarding the diastolic blood pressure or the arterial middle pressure, clearly indicating the need of fasciotomy []. In our case we initially suspected a deep vein thrombosis and not a compartment syndrome. Therefore we decided for a CT scan. After the diagnosis surgery was performed immediatly and no further diagnostic was performed. Usually suspecting a compartment syndrome calculating the local perfusion pressure by measuring the the mean arterial pressure and the intramascular pressure is the gold standard.\nBecause of the wide variety of conditions in patients with huge differences in the physiological strength (young men in a car accident versus a 94-year-old women with a stable pelvic fracture) and the very limited numbers of cases with a compartment syndrome of the thigh explains why it is impossible to identify strict criteria for the need of a fascitomy. However the literature agrees that the damage caused by fasciotomy in a patient in which the tissue would not have become necrotic is far outweighed by the morbidity possibly associated by a full-blown compartment syndrome []. In a borderline compartment syndrome not only the intracompartmental pressure but close meshed checks of the sensormotor function of the affected leg as well as the typical clinical symptoms are essential for the indication of a fasciotomy.\nIn our patient the compartment syndrome developed with several days delay. This we hypothezised might be explained by the patient's clinical course. During the first days the patient was immobilized with bed rest. During remobilisation the vessels injured by the initial trauma started to bleed again, thereby creating a haematoma which followed gravity into the thigh. In our case the neurological symptoms resolved quickly after the decompression and no muscle necrosis were detected. However in this case the morbidity was caused by the high age of the patient resulting in multiple complications through a prolonged wound healing. Schwartz has already emphasized that infection is a further problem in the postoperative course in patients with a compartment syndrome. He reports local infection rate of 66% []. Although we were not able to detect any significant tissue necrosis in our patient we suppose that prolonged ischemia may have further compromised the microvascular perfusion in this old patient with already existing vascular sclerosis thus drastically increasing the risk of wound infection.

R.F. is a healthy appearing 55 year old man who had gross hematuria February 2016. His past medical history is negative with the exception of a 15 pack/year history of cigarette smoking. He had a normal CT scan with the exception of a bladder tumor located in the posterior wall of the bladder. He underwent an uneventful transurethral resection of a papillary bladder tumor in March 2016 at another medical center.\nHe received a single postoperative dose of intravesical mitomycin C 40 mg in 40 ml in the recovery room.\nThe pathology report indicated a high grade (grade 3) urothelial carcinoma which invaded the lamina propria. There was muscularis propria present in the specimen and there was no invasion beyond the lamina propria.\nThe patient did not receive additional adjuvant therapy. He began to have marked urinary frequency and dysuria shortly after the TUR BT.\nI initially saw him in December 2016. He still had marked lower urinary tract symptoms. He voids every 1–2 hours – day and night. Anticholinergic medications were tried without improvement. He has not had a urinary tract infection.\nA flexible cystoscopy in December 2016 revealed a 4–5 cm denuded area on the posterior wall of the bladder with calcifications on the surface. There was no obvious tumor in the bladder. A voided and bladder wash urine for cytology indicated atypical cells.\nAlthough an office cystoscopy in March 2017 was unchanged a urine cytology was reported as high grade urothelial cancer. Cystoscopy and bladder biopsies were therefore performed under anesthesia. The same denuded area was observed on the posterior wall. The rest of the bladder appeared normal as did the prostatic urethra. Cold cup bladder biopsies did not indicate cancer. Urine cytology was again consistent with high grade cancer.\nI performed a flexible cystoscopy and obtained urine for cytology in October 2017. The abnormal appearing concretions were again observed on the denuded urothelium on the posterior wall. The remainder of the bladder was normal. The cytology was again positive for high grade cancer.\nThe patient's voiding symptoms persist and are a major quality of life problem.\nA recent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is perfectly normal with the exception of a line of calcification at the posterior bladder wall consistent with the endoscopic findings.\nWhat should one do? Possibilities include a partial cystectomy, total cystectomy or cystoprostatectomy and neobladder, or continued monitoring.

The patient was a 43-year-old male who denied significant past medical history. He presented to the emergency department with the chief complaint of right flank pain and left foot pain after being struck by lightning just prior to presentation. The patient reported that the injury occurred immediately after he had stepped out of his truck while working on a farm. He was thrown to the ground by a bolt of lightning that struck the truck and himself. The patient denied loss of consciousness during the event and complaints of injury due to being thrown to the ground.\nAfter the lightning strike, the patient indicated that he lost sensation and motor control of his lower extremities for approximately 30 minutes. Upon presentation, the patient regained full sensation and motor strength in the lower extremities bilaterally. The patient additionally complained of a rash to the right flank, arm, and left foot. He reported an allergy to penicillin. He took no medications and reported no chronic medical conditions. He indicated that the truck was on fire after the event but denied smoke inhalation and other thermal burn injuries. He reported ear pain.\nThe patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.6° C, heart rate 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, blood pressure 145/114 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99%. On physical examination, the patient was awake, alert, in no distress, and was not toxic in appearance. His head was normocephalic and atraumatic. His eyes were atraumatic, equal, and reactive to light and accommodation; extraocular motions were intact. The patient's mouth and pharynx were atraumatic, his airway was patent, mucous membranes moist, the pharynx was normal in appearance and pink and coloration, and there was no facial swelling. The inspection of the patient's ears bilaterally revealed no tympanic membrane perforation or other damage. The mouth had moist mucous membranes and was without hypersalivation or pooling of secretions. His lungs were clear to auscultation with normal breath sounds. Breath sounds were equal bilaterally, and the patient was not in respiratory distress. No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing were noted. On cardiac examination, normal rate and normal sinus rhythm were noted. Heart sounds were normal, and the patient had +2 pulses in all four extremities with less than two-second capillary refill.\nThe abdomen was soft and non-tender with no guarding or rebound. The inspection of the patient's skin revealed a large Lichtenberg figure (Figure ). On the right flank, the chest was purple in coloration and light in contrast with the surrounding skin. The palpation of the area revealed no pain. The right upper extremity had a Lichtenberg figure that was pink in coloration and encompassed the right, lateral, anterior, and medial bicep (Figure ).\nThe upper extremities were otherwise atraumatic and had full strength, sensation, and range of motion. No circumferential injury, clubbing, or cyanosis was noted. The patient's skin showed the previously mentioned Lichtenberg figure but was otherwise warm, dry, and free of lacerations and abrasions. Neurologic examination revealed that the patient was awake, alert, and oriented. The speech was normal, and the patient had no motor or sensory deficits. Upper and lower extremities had +5/5 strength. The sensation was intact, and all dermatomes were tested.\nLaboratory evaluation (Table ), including urinalysis, were unremarkable.\nRepeat labs, including potassium and creatinine kinase, were drawn two hours after the initial labs were done and showed no upward trend of potassium or creatinine kinase. The electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities or arrhythmias (Figure ).\nA 1 L bolus of normal saline was initiated as a prophylactic treatment for rhabdomyolysis prior to initial lab results. This was performed to proactively treat any developing rhabdomyolysis that should occur. As the patient's lab results did not show signs of rhabdomyolysis, fluids were discontinued. The patient was offered pain control medication; however, he refused as he reported minimal pain.

A 47-year-old female patient referred to us because of a history of a nonimmediate type HR to radio contrast media that occurred 3 years previously and immediate type HRs to clarithromycin at 2 different times in order to identify safe alternative antibiotics. We started drug allergy work-up with the confirmation of the clarithromycin hypersensitivity which is relatively rare []. The prick test performed with clarithromycin was positive []. Because claritromycin can lead to false positive result due to irritation effect we offered drug provocation test but the patient refused. Then in order to identify safe alternative antibiotics we performed the skin prick and intradermal tests with moxifloxacin as previously suggested which were negative []. Delayed reading of intradermal tests were negative as well. She was then challenged in a single blind placebo controlled manner with moxifloxacin orally. It was planned to give the drug with incremental doses of 5-50-100-100-150 mg with 30 minutes intervals. After the second dose of 50 mg, pruritus and mild erythema on her body occurred in minutes and followed by dizziness. Patient's pulse was very weakly palpable, tachycardic and the blood pressure was very low that could not be measured. She was treated immediately with 0.5 mg of epinephrine, fluid replacement, 40 mg of methylprednisolone (intravenous) and 45.5 mg of pheniramine (intravenous). On the following day she returned with macular eruptions on the trunk and on the proximal extremities which had started with pruritus approximately 20 hours after the drug ingestion (). Her biochemical tests and differential blood counts were normal. She did not consume any other drugs concomitantly and she had no signs or symptoms of infections. She was treated with methylprednisolone and approximately in 10 days eruptions resolved. A patch test performed with moxifloxacin diluted in petrolatum to obtain the drug concentration of 30% was applied on the upper back approximately 2 months later, after the resolution of signs and symptoms, was found positive (), confirming nonimmediate type HR reaction to moxifloxacin []. To check the possible irritation effect of the drug, we performed patch test with the drug in 5 patients who were known to tolerate moxifloxacin and all they were negative. In order to support the diagnosis of immediate and nonimmediate type reactions, lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) and intracellular interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels and basophil activation test (BAT) were performed as described in the literature []. A stimulation index for LTT was defined as proliferation ratio of moxifloxacin-specific CD4+ T cell to unstimulated cells and result of BAT was interpreted as positive when the percentage of CD63 was 5% above the negative control []. BAT was negative while the CD4+ T-cell proliferation stimulation indexes were found 1.75 and 1.65 in doses of 5- and 10-μg/mL moxifloxacin, respectively. Moreover, intracellular IL-4 level was high and IFN-γ level was low in CD4+ T cells when compared with a healthy subject (). She was subsequently able to tolerate clindamycin.

An 18-year-old Caucasian man with recurrent hemoptysis was referred to our hospital. A diagnosis of Hughes-Stovin syndrome had already been established in a previous hospital admission []. He had had some incidents of spontaneous non-productive cough several days prior to his admission.\nDuring his previous admission three months before his current presentation, his physical examination was normal apart from mild, tender swelling of his left thigh and calf caused by DVT (left external iliac and femoral vein) detected by color duplex examination. His oropharynx and larynx were normal, and his mucous membranes were free of ulcers. Chest radiography revealed a round opacity in the right medial pulmonary field. CT of the chest showed an aneurysm in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery, together with mural thrombus, that had a diameter of 3.5 cm in the lower lobe of the right lung. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the cerebral venosus sinuses and the pulmonary arteries (Figure ) was performed to clarify the etiology of the patient's headaches and to plan possible embolization of the aneurysm. Cerebral MRA revealed multiple chronic thromboses of the sclera mater venous sinuses. The rare diagnosis of systemic vasculitis Hughes-Stovin syndrome was made on the basis of the pulmonary artery aneurysm and peripheral venous thromboses in such a young patient. There were no findings consistent with Behçet's disease.\nThe patient was initially treated with corticosteroids. His hemoptysis resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone treatment after about 25 days. Upon his second admission, because of his recurrent hemoptysis, we decided to perform percutaneous embolization of the pulmonary artery aneurysm.\nThe aneurysm was initially embolized with steel microcoils via an infusion catheter. Subsequently, an Amplatzer Vascular Plug (AGA Medical Corp., Plymouth, MN, USA) with a diameter of 16 mm was inserted into the cavity of the aneurysm. The procedure ended without any complications, and afterward there was no evidence of the pulmonary embolism (Figure ). The patient's post-interventional course was uneventful, and he was discharged 30 days after the procedure. He was prescribed anti-coagulants (acenocoumarol) and immunosuppressant corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) to control his vasculitis. The patient developed a new DVT in his lower extremities during follow-up (in the 30th month) after temporary discontinuation of anti-coagulant treatment. Nevertheless, he has not had any complications from the aneurysm 36 months after undergoing embolization, and follow-up CT showed the completely thrombosed pulmonary artery aneurysm.

A 44-year old male was referred following investigation for chest pain and dyspnoea. He had no pre-existing co-morbidities. Physical examination revealed feeble femoral pulses and he was found to be hypertensive with marked differences between the upper and lower limbs (systolic blood pressure upper limb 190mmmHg, lower limb 75 mmHg, with an ankle brachial index (ABI) of 0.39). Electrocardiogram revealed evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. This was confirmed with echocardiography which also demonstrated a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation in the presence of an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function was preserved. Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to evaluate the aortic pathology in further detail (Fig. ). The scan noted an aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), in addition to the presence of severe aortic coarctation, with subtotal occlusion and a lumen less than 6 mm in size. The coarctation was just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus. There was clear evidence of collateral circulation to the descending thoracic aorta via the subclavian and intercostal arteries. Coronary angiography confirmed a right dominant coronary system with no significant coronary disease.\nA multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful via the femoral approach, as the guidewire could not cross the coarctation. Assessment through angiography via the left brachial artery showed complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus. The decision was then made to proceed to a single stage surgical approach to treat both lesions.\nAfter induction of anaesthesia, arterial lines were placed in the left radial and left femoral artery. A right infraclavicular incision and a right groin incision was made this was to establish peripheral arterial cannulation access to the right axillary and right femoral artery. An 8 mm dacron graft was anastomosed to each vessel for indirect cannulation. Median sternotomy was performed to access the mediastinum and expose the heart and aorta. Following heparinisation cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established with venous return from bi-caval cannulation. The body temperature was cooled to 25 degrees Celsius. The right superior pulmonary vein was used for venting. Once the cross clamp was applied, complete cardiac arrest was achieved using Custodiol 25 ml/kg crystalloid cardioplegia via a retrograde cannula through the coronary sinus. A further top up of cardioplegia was given once the aorta was opened through direct cannulation of the coronary ostia.\nThe aortic root, valve and ascending aorta were excised. The coronary ostia were fashioned as buttons from the native aortic root. The coronary ostia were noted to be significantly displaced, with distorted anatomy due to the patient's disease process. Therefore, 8 mm dacron grafts were attached end-to-end to each ostia, with view to performing the modified Cabrol technique later following replacement of the root. The heart was then retracted in a cephalad position to access the posterior pericardium. A vertical incision was made to expose the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). An end to side anastomosis was formed with a 20 mm dacron graft to the DTA (Fig. ). This graft was then routed posterior to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and anterior to the right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV), adjacent to the right atrium (RA). Root replacement was then performed with a 25 mm biological valved-conduit, as this was favoured by the patient over a mechanical prosthesis, despite the risk of a difficult redo procedure in the future. The 8 mm dacron grafts attached to the coronary ostia were anastmosed to the root conduit as neo coronary ostia. The distal part of the valved-conduit was anastomosed to the proximal arch under selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP). Finally, an end to side anastomosis was fashioned between the 20 mm extra-cardiac graft (attached to the descending thoracic aorta) and the ascending portion of the valved-conduit. Valve-sparing root replacement was not considered in this patient due to the grossly abnormal aortic anatomy.\nFollowing rewarming and deairing the patient was successfully weaned off CPB. The bypass time was 160 min, the cross-clamp time was 120 min, and the SACP time was 40 min. Haemostasis was achieved and thereafter a routine closure of all incision sites. The patient remained in ICU for less than 48 h, and made excellent progress on the ward. Minimal anti-hypertensives were required and the patient was discharged on 8th day post operatively neurologically intact and independent. At 3 months follow up the patient underwent a repeat CTA scan which showed complete patency in the extra-anatomical graft and resolution of the collateral arterial network (Fig. ).

A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department in an unresponsive state with the chief complaint of dyspnea and chest pain which was left-sided and sharp in nature for two hours followed by collapse. She had a history of mild dry cough for the past five weeks ever since she contracted COVID-19 when her CT severity score was 5/25, all her investigations including D-Dimer, C-reactive protein, and serum ferritin were within normal limits and she was home quarantined for the same. She had no history of fever, loss of taste or smell. There was no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thyroid disorder, or any other co-morbidities. The patient was a nonsmoker. There was no history of supraventricular tachycardia or any other arrhythmias in the past. The patient was immediately intubated in view of airway protection. ECG was suggestive of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate of 150 beats/minute and diffuse significant ST depressions with ST elevation in the augmented vector right (aVR) (Figure ).\nShe was managed with intravenous 6 mg adenosine. Cardiac markers were also measured revealing creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) to be 10 IU/L and Troponin I 0.02 ng/mL. The patient went into sudden cardiorespiratory arrest and was revived with two cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation along with norepinephrine showing sinus rhythm on ECG. She was shifted to the intensive care unit. On general examination her pulse was 98 beats/minute, blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg in right arm supine position, oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 93 percent on T-piece with the oxygen of 4 liter and respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute. On systemic examination air entry was reduced on the left infra scapular area, heart sounds were normal, the abdomen was soft and non-tender and the patient was drowsy with bilateral plantar flexor and neuro deficit. Lab investigations revealed a raised D-Dimer level at 1.51 and the rest of the investigations are shown in Table .\nThe patient was taken for computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography which showed pulmonary embolism along with pulmonary infarct as shown in Figures , . She was started on intravenous heparin 5000 IU six-hourly along with steroids. and other supportive measures. During the course of the hospital stay the patient improved clinically and she regained full consciousness and was extubated on day three of admission. Echocardiography was done which revealed no signs of wall motion abnormality or hypokinesia. Incentive spirometry and respiratory physiotherapy were given regularly. She was shifted from intravenous heparin to oral rivaroxaban 10mg BD (twice a day) on day four of admission. The patient was discharged in stable condition on day fifteen of admission and is currently doing well on follow-up.

We report a case of a 40-year-old female (gravida 5 para 4, gestational age 32 weeks) who attended the obstetrics and gynaecology outpatient clinic in our institute. She complained of repeated episodes of vaginal bleeding. Abdominal examination revealed a disproportionately high uterine fundal level that was not matching her corresponding gestational age. Abdominal ultrasound examination showed a viable, single intrauterine 32 weeks fetus. On screening the adnexal regions, bilateral highly vascular complex adnexal masses were identified, measuring 8 × 6 cm² on the right side and 12 × 8 cm² on the left side (). Transvaginal ultrasound imaging showed an additional highly vascular polypoidal mass projecting in the upper vagina, indistinct from a rather bulky cervix. Solid peritoneal deposits were also identified in the Douglas pouch (). Further evaluation of the pelvis by MRI was requested and a non-contrast study was performed at the same institute after a 1-week interval, which was interpreted by a different set of readers. T2 weighted images showed findings matching those of the preliminary pelvic ultrasound imaging (). Functional data concerning the cellularity and integrity of the cell membranes of the adnexal and vaginal masses was provided by the diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) sequence. On the DWI sequence, the masses showed restricted diffusion in the form of persistent bright signal intensity and low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, which strongly favoured likely malignant pathology (). Laboratory data were within normal limits apart from a raised CA-125 level. Corticosteroids were administered to ensure fetal lung maturity. The pregnancy was terminated by an elective caesarean section at 34 weeks gestation via a midline subumbilical incision. A 2.5 kg living normal fetus was extracted. The abdomen was explored and the bilateral complex adnexal masses were identified, together with the multiple omental metastatic nodules and bloody ascites. The right ovarian mass was attached to the posterior abdominal wall and was inseparable from the sacral promontory. Debulking of the ovarian lesions, panhysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy were performed. Minimal tumour residue that was adherent to bone could not be removed. Vaginal exploration was also performed to remove the polypoidal vaginal component, which was grasped and totally excised. It was completely separable from the cervix. Pathological examination revealed an undifferentiated ovarian adenocarcinoma (grade 3), metastasizing to the upper vagina with clear cervical margins. The patient is now undergoing chemotherapy.

A 79-year-old male with a medical history of cholelithiasis, for which he underwent cholecystectomy 11 years ago, hyperlipidemia, essential hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was admitted for mild acute pancreatitis. His presentation included severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, lipase of 1840 u/L, and no organ failure. He denied fever, chills, or body aches. The patient denied alcohol consumption and reported to have quit smoking 41 years ago. Liver chemistries, serum bilirubin, serum triglycerides, and immunoglobulin subclasses were within normal limits (). Abdominal CT scan demonstrated peripancreatic haziness consistent with noncomplicated acute pancreatitis (). Home medications included atorvastatin for several years and the addition of 160 mg fenofibrate six months prior to admission. These medications were held upon admission but resumed at discharge. Full medication lists on admission and at discharge are shown in (). The patient was managed with fluid resuscitation and pain control. The patient recovered well and was able to tolerate regular diet without any pain or nausea. The patient was discharged in a stable condition after three hospital admission days, and lipase level at the day of discharge was 307 u/l.\nThree days later, the patient returned with similar symptoms. Lipase levels were >30,000 u/l (), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis (). The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain control, and nothing per mouth until his symptoms resolved. Four days after his second admission, the patient recovered well and was discharged home in a stable condition. Fenofibrate and atorvastatin were discontinued ().\nTwo months later, the patient remained asymptomatic and returned for further workup to rule out an alternative cause to fenofibrate-induced pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was done, which showed a 12 mm x 20 mm pancreatic head mass without pancreatic duct stenosis, strictures, or dilation. There were no common bile duct abnormalities. Fine needle aspiration was performed, and cytology was negative for malignant cells. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed to place a prophylactic pancreatic duct stent. Cholangiogram revealed a normal biliary system without dilation or strictures. The biliary tree was swept, and nothing was found. A prophylactic pancreatic duct stent was placed and a prophylactic sphincterotomy was performed. No recurrence of pancreatitis has occurred as of 6-month follow-up.\nGiven the course of the patient's illnesses in relation to fenofibrate usage, the timespan of drug initiation, and the fact that he had been taking atorvastatin for many years without previous signs or symptoms of acute pancreatitis, we hypothesize that his recurrent disease is probably due to the use of fenofibrate.

A 45-year-old female presented at the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of a public hospital in the city of Recife, Brazil, complaining of an increase in volume on the right side of her face and being unable to open her mouth adequately for more than a year. She reported not having suffered facial trauma or infections in the region. The extraoral examination revealed an increase in volume of the right zygomatic arch and palpation revealed hard tissue mass [], which was not evident in the intraoral inspection. The patient had limited mouth opening (8 mm), with an inability to perform protrusive or lateral movements. No pain symptoms were reported.\nThe tomogram revealed altered anatomy of the coronoid process, with a radiopaque mushroom shaped characteristic developing in an upward and lateral direction, invading the infratemporal space and causing deformity of the zygomatic arch. The upper region of the tumor had a growth on the zygomatic arch exceeding the limit of the infratemporal cavity and causing limited mouth opening with the inability to perform excursive movements. The lateral growth had caused deformity and fracture of the right zygomatic arch. The fracture line was evident in the three-dimensional reconstruction [].\nOn the basis of the clinical and imaging features, a preliminary diagnosis of pseudo-ankylosis of the right coronoid process was established. The patient was hospitalized and underwent a coronoidectomy under general anesthesia. Osteotomy of the coronoid process was performed using an intraoral incision. The removal of the fibrous tissue between the tumor and zygomatic arch and excision of the tumor were performed using a coronal incision [].\nThe specimen measured about 3 cm at its largest diameter and had a shape similar to a mushroom []. The microscopic analysis revealed sclerotic, lamellar and dense bone similar to the cortical bone, allowing the diagnosis of osteoma of the mandibular coronoid process [].\nPostoperative recovery was satisfactory. No occlusal changes were observed and mouth opening had increased to 25 mm. Signs of injury to the temporal branch of the facial nerve were also observed. The patient was referred to a physiotherapist for the recovery of the full range of mandibular movements and the stimulation of nerve function. After 1 year of clinical and X-ray follow-up, the patient had experienced recovery of her normal facial contour, full recovery of nerve function, the return of excursive mandibular movements and maximum mouth opening had increased to 37 mm [Figures and ]. Moreover, there were no signs of recurrence.

A 19-year-old male presented in the emergency department with one episode of melena per day, for one week. It was associated with vomiting, shortness of breath and palpitations. His hemoglobin level on initial complete blood count was 5.80 g/dL, signifying severe anemia according to WHO guidelines []. His lab parameters on admission are presented in Table .\nImmediately packed red blood cells (RBCs) were requested from the blood bank. On forward typing his blood group was labeled as O positive and his serum showed strongly positive indirect Coomb's test with a negative direct Coomb's. On extended 11 cell panel antibody testing, his serum demonstrated pan-agglutination which matched with monoclonal panel cells having anti-Kell, anti-Lub, and anti-Kpb antibodies. On cross match with four O negative and four O positive packed RBCs, +4 incompatibility was seen with all. Meanwhile a detailed history of the patient revealed two distinct episodes of epistaxis in childhood and a family history of his paternal grandmother having an increased bleeding tendency. In view of his past history of fresh frozen plasma infusions, it was interpreted that the patient may have multiple alloantibodies in blood leading to gross incompatibility. Considering the urgency of the situation, one unit of the least incompatible (O negative) packed RBCs was issued after washing with normal saline thrice, to the emergency department. Transfusion was started under strict monitoring by the emergency department physicians. After slow transfusion of around 10 ml blood, the patient started shivering and his temperature spiked to 101°F with tachycardia and hypotension. The transfusion was stopped immediately and the patient was given intravenous antihistamine and hydrocortisone. Meanwhile, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he received intranasal desmopressin and intravenous factor VIII.\nTransfusion reaction workup revealed a grade 4+ pan agglutination in his serum. During repeat blood grouping, forward typing did not demonstrate any reaction to anti-A and anti-B antisera, like a normal O blood group. However, on reverse typing, his serum showed strong agglutination with group O pooled control cells. His post saline wash incompatibility with O negative red cell concentrate showed minor difference from grade +4 agglutination (pre-wash) to grade +3 clumping (post-wash). A fresh RBCs sample from the patient showed negative direct Coomb's test, while fresh serum sample remained positive for indirect Coomb's test. This workup strongly raised the suspicion of Bombay phenotype and his red cells were tested with anti-H lectin, which showed no agglutination. This confirmed his blood group as Bombay phenotype. The reactions observed with Bombay phenotype compared to other blood groups, on forward and reverse typing, are illustrated in Table .\nImmediately, voluntary donor pools were contacted in blood banks throughout the country. Overnight, a donor with Bombay negative blood group was arranged from Karachi. The packed RBCs were airlifted to Islamabad maintaining the cold chain. After crossmatching with recipient's blood showed no reaction, the donor blood was transfused to the patient. Meanwhile, a distant relative of the patient from a nearby city, with Bombay positive blood group, consented to donate blood at our blood bank. Two days later, another unit of packed RBCs was transfused to the patient. His hemoglobin after two transfusions rose up to 7.40 g/dL. As his melena settled down on supportive therapy, an endoscopy was performed that suggested an underlying hiatal hernia. After surgical consultation, the patient was advised to reduce weight and discharged from the hospital, with a scheduled follow-up visit.\nIn view of the patient's past medical history and family history, during the follow-up visit, a von Willebrand factor antigen, von Willebrand factor functional activity and factor VIII levels were ordered. His von Willebrand factor antigen level was <2.0%, von Willebrand factor functional activity was <4.0% and factor VIII level was 18.5%, consistent with type 3 von Willebrand disease. The patient and his family were counselled accordingly and referred to the hematology clinic.

The third patient was a 62-year-old male with multiple medical problems included HCV genotype 1a, coronary artery disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He developed liver cirrhosis and HCC secondary to HCV infection. With exceptional MELD points granted for HCC the patient received a liver from a brain-dead donor. Prior to transplantation, the patient failed treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.\nAfter two months of transplantation, the patient had worsening jaundice and was frequently complaining of abdominal pain. AST and ALT were elevated and serum TB was reached 22.1 mg/dL. The patient underwent ERCP that showed a focal biliary stricture in the post-transplantation anastomosis. A liver biopsy at this time demonstrated focal mild portal and lobular inflammation with mild ductular reactive without changes of cellular rejection. Additionally there was no definite hepatocellular injury or fibrosis. Biliary sphincterotomy with dilatation and stenting of the anastomotic stricture were performed but did not alleviate patient's symptoms. He continued to have a worsening jaundice despite a repeated ERCP and successfully replacing the stent. A liver biopsy performed four months post-OLT revealed diffuse hepatocyte swelling with associated hepatocyte injury, and no evidence of endotheliitis. The trichrome stain confirmed the presence of periportal and perilobular fibrosis with rare fibrous bridge. These features were consistent with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis C. His HCV viral load was >69,000,000 IU/mL.\nTreatment for HCV was started with SOF-SMV. HCV viral load decreased to 3200 IU/mL at week two and became undetectable at week six of the treatment. His liver biochemistries improved markedly at week six of the treatment. However, the patient developed recurrent abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that required two ER visits. Liver ultrasonography was concerning for hepatic artery stenosis. Hepatic angiogram showed marked stenosis suggesting transplanted hepatic artery thrombosis. Paracentesis was performed for new ascites and fluid analysis showed severe leukocytosis and cultures later grew E. coli. He went into respiratory failure, required endotracheal intubation and stayed in the ICU for three days. He died of sepsis and multiorgan failure, which complicated his ICU stay.

An 18 year old woman was referred to our outpatient clinic of Endocrinology, University-Hospital of Naples Federico II because of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Blood samples showed high levels of thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies and normal calcitonin serum levels. The patient was euthyroid with normal serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4) during replacement therapy with L-T4. At physical examination, a palpable nodule of ~2 cm in size was detected in the isthmus of the thyroid. There were no palpable cervical lymph-nodes. An US evaluation confirmed an isolated lesion located in the isthmus, showing an isoechoic solid nodule with smooth margins; its size was 18 × 13 × 6 mm with intra and perilesional vascularity (Figure ). Therefore, a FNA was performed and cytological results revealed a TIR3A lesion. The cytological specimen showed an increased cellularity with some microfollicular structures in the background of scant colloid (Figure ). Thus, we assessed the risk factors associated with the isolated TIR 3A nodule of our patient. According to the ATA guidelines we repeated the FNA which confirmed the same result (TIR3A). The second US (after 6 months) showed that there were no clear signs suggesting malignancy such as microcalcifications or taller than wide-shaped nodules. However, we found a small hypoechoic cranial component in the nodule with blurred margins and elastography revealed an increased stiffness in this cranial component. No nodules were detected in the contralateral lobes by US; cervical lymph nodes were normal. Among the possible risk factors, our patient referred a familial history of thyroid cancer. Her mother was submitted to total thyroidectomy for a follicular variant of PTC twenty years ago; our subsequent evaluation showed that she was disease free at the moment.\nOn this basis, we decided that a surgical treatment was indicated for our patient and assessed the risk/benefit of total thyroidectomy vs. isthmusectomy.

A 52-year-old male with a 5-week history of severe headaches was admitted after he had a syncopal episode while at home. He found himself down on the ground, and he was unaware of the initiating circumstances. There was no post-event confusion, weakness, tongue biting, incontinence of bowel or bladder, or any reported head trauma after the incident. This was the first such episode he was able to infer that occurred after having found himself on the floor. His headache was worse in the left temporal region and radiated through his neck, progressively increasing in severity over time. His headaches were described as severe, especially when he turned his head to the left. Over the past several months, he noted occasional drenching night sweats and a 40-pound unintentional weight loss over 6 months. Past medical history is significant for smoking 2 packs per day for the past 30 years, but otherwise he has no chronic diseases and takes no medications regularly.\nWhile in the emergency department, he had several episodes of bradycardia noted on telemetry and had accompanying hypotension with values reaching as low as 60/31 mm Hg at one point. He was dizzy during these episodes, and both his blood pressure and heart rate responded to 0.5 mg of intravenous atropine. An electrocardiogram obtained during one of the episodes showed sinus bradycardia, ventricular rate of 25 beats per minute, with no signs of atrioventricular dysfunction or ischemia.\nPhysical examination revealed a large ulcerative lesion in the left tonsillar area with tenderness in the left submandibular region. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated in the neck. The rest of his examination was grossly normal. His heart rate and blood pressure, measured after an episode had resolved, was 93 beats per minute and 113/61 mm Hg, respectively; vital signs were otherwise normal. Routine laboratory investigation was normal. A computed tomographic angiography of the head and neck showed extensive soft-tissue swelling of the left palatine tonsil and surrounding tissues. Otolaryngology was consulted, and a biopsy of the left tonsillar mass was obtained. The histology of the left tonsillar lesion was consistent with invasive squamous cell carcinoma and was P16 positive on immunostain. A subsequent positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed hypermetabolic regions in the posterior tongue extending to the left palatine tonsil, in addition to metastatic involvement of left jugular chain. He was diagnosed with stage IVa squamous cell cancer with nodal involvement of the left jugular chain. Echocardiography failed to show any abnormalities. Interestingly, most of his episodes of bradycardia and hypotension were preceded by changes in neck position (he had repeated episodes of bradycardia when he moved his neck in certain ways), which was initially attributed to a vasovagal response related to pain.\nThe patient continued to have repeated episodes of symptomatic hypotension and bradycardia throughout his stay. He was started on a trial of benztropine (2 mg every 8 hours initially) to help ameliorate these symptoms. After increasing the dose over several days, he continued to have episodes of hypotension and bradycardia and was ultimately started on a dopamine drip. He continued to require dopamine infusions intermittently, and phenylephrine was added on as well. Intravenous atropine continued to be the only treatment to consistently provide relief. After failing to improve on the benztropine, he was started on midodrine (5 mg twice daily) and sertraline (50 mg daily).\nOnce being started on this regimen, he had no further episodes of bradycardia and required no more atropine. Although he had several episodes of orthostatic hypotension, complicated by acute blood loss anemia, he was able to eventually come off the dopamine and phenylephrine drip completely once the bleeding was stopped. Also, he began treatment with high-dose cisplatin 1 week into his stay, and started a course of 35 rounds of radiation therapy 2 weeks into his stay. He remains on midodrine, sertraline, and cisplatin every 3 weeks, and he is over halfway through radiation therapy without any recurrences of syncope.\nThis patient's picture was consistent with a small number of case reports describing neurocardiogenic syncope secondary to head and neck cancer. In this case, it was thought to be due to irritation of the glossopharyngeal nerve with spread of the cancer to the jugular chain.

A 60-year-old man with AF was admitted to our hospital after experiencing dyspnea, orthopnea, and a non-productive cough for 2 weeks. The patient had a 10-year history of longstanding persistent AF, four previous radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures (10, 9, and 2 years, and 5 months prior to admission), and a strong family history of AF with ischemic stroke. His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 0 (male, age <60 years old, and no congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism, or vascular disease), and highly symptomatic paroxysmal AF remained after multiple procedures. Although this patient had undergone his 1st and 2nd procedures at another institute and we have limited information based on the medical record, he did show arrhythmogenic PV triggers from the left upper PV. At the 3rd procedure, we had found reconnected PV potentials at the left superior PV and right inferior PV and noted persistence of AF triggers from the left superior PV. Therefore, we had conducted complete circumferential PV isolation and added linear ablations. However, AF recurred as paroxysmal type. At the 4th procedure, all PV isolations and bidirectional blocks of linear ablation were maintained well, and a complex fractionated atrial electrogram-guided ablation was added (). Although a left upper PV trigger occurred during the first three procedures, we did not confirm the exit block by inside PV pacing at the last procedure. To exclude potential epicardial conduction after circumferential PV isolation, inside PV pacing with maximal electrode contact might be important, especially during repeat procedures. There was no evidence of non-PV triggers after electrical cardioversion under isoproterenol infusion. At that time, 75% luminal narrowing of the left superior PV was noticed, but there were no respiratory symptoms. However, the patient became symptomatic with AF recurrence 5 months later, and 3-dimensional-computed tomography (CT) revealed progression of PV stenosis with a significantly atrophied left atrium (). An increased left superior PV systolic peak flow velocity (251 cm/s) with turbulent flow at the PV ostium was observed on the transesophageal echocardiogram (). Based on the diagnosis of clinically significant left superior PV stenosis (), balloon-expandable stent deployment (10×19 mm, OMNILINK, Abbott Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) after balloon angioplasty (8×20 mm, POWERFLEX, Cordis Inc., Hialeah, FL, USA) () was performed. Sinus rhythm was restored, and the patient exhibited no apparent symptoms related to PV stenosis or AF recurrence 1 day after PV stenting. A follow-up CT performed 12 months after the procedure showed a patent left superior PV (). There was no recurrence of AF based on 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram monitoring based on 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines during regular follow-ups for 2 years ().

A 17-years old unmarried female from Bajura district of Nepal came to the dermatology out-patient department with a complaint of a single plaque over the right upper lip for the last 6 months. Lesion started as a small red papule which gradually increased in size with central crusting. No history of fever or weight loss was given. There was no significant family or medical history. Multiple over the counter treatment was used as trial without relief. There was no history of travel outside of her village until the time for consultation.\nOn examination, a single round to oval crusted plaque approximately 1.5 × 1.5 cm was noted over the right upper lip. Neither an induration nor easy bleeding was noted. No regional lymphadenopathy was present ().\nA slit skin examination was done for acid-fast and Giemsa stain which was negative for any organism. An incisional biopsy was done which showed multiple epitheloid type multinucleated giant cells suggesting Lupus vulgaris. However, a mantoux test revealed an induration of only 2 mm in 48 hours.\nThe morphology of lesion prompted us to investigate furthermore for cutaneous leishmaniasis before starting on anti-tubercular medications. We decided to do PCR for Leishmania species from the lesion. The sample was sent to the Laboratory of the Central Department of Biotechnology, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal due to unavailability of PCR in the National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir hospital. PCR was done using the nested protocol previously described by Noyes, et al. in 1998. The DNA template for PCR was extracted manually from the lesional tissue. After second-round PCR, a band size corresponding to the size of approximately 700 bp was obtained that confirmed the presence of Leishmania parasite (). The band size corresponded to that typical of Leishmania donovani.\nA serological test conducted with an rk39 rapid diagnostic test kit also tested positive for this case.\nAn ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis was normal. Liver function tests, renal function test, and blood sugar were also all within normal limits.\nPatient was diagnosed as a case of cutaneous leishmaniasis and was advised for follow-ups without any treatment. The patient came for follow-up in one month's time where the plaque had decreased significantly (). The patient was advised for regular follow-ups on a monthly basis till the lesion subsided. The lesion healed spontaneously within a couple of months.

A 63-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining that he presented abdominal pain and feculent effluent. He was hospitalized for uremia treated with peritoneal dialysis 5 years ago. The possible reason for uremia was chronic glomerulonephropathy, and the renal biopsy was not performed. He remained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis without complications for 5 years till he instilled hot dialysis solution, which was heated in a microwave oven on high for 5 min by his new caretaker in a nursing home 3 weeks before. (The caretaker was a fresh man and came from a nursing home without enough education and training of peritoneal dialysis.)The patient went to the emergency room immediately because of severe abdominal pain. There was no signs of bowel perforation and peritonitis. No abnormality was found in abdominal X ray and complete blood count. The peritoneal fluid culture was sent. He was asked to fast for 5 days and administered with preventive antibacterial treatment. Meanwhile he ceased peritoneal dialysis and was converted to non-heparin hemodialysis. The abdominal pain relieved and the peritoneal drainage was clear, so he asked for being discharged from the hospital on the second day against medical advice. After 3 days, the microbiological analysis of the peritoneal fluid revealed growth of Enterococcus faecium. He was treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotics in the emergency room of another hospital. After 10 days of IV treatment, he felt pain in the abdomen again and feculent effluent was found in the peritoneal catheter. He was readmitted to our hospital.\nExamination on admission indicated that he was afebrile and had a soft、tender abdomen. Blood examination showed white blood cell count 21.88 × 109/l, hemoglobin 72 g/l, neutrophil count 19.89 × 109/l. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed peri-hepatic pneumatosis and effusion. No free air or dilated loops of bowel were seen. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. A great mount of pus mosses and fecal fluid were found in the abdominal cavity and between intestines. There were multiple perforation holes on the small bowel (the largest one 4*3 cm) and a single perforation (1*1 cm) on the anterior rectum wall. A section of the small bowel was resected (Figs. and ). Other perforation holes were repaired and ileostomy was performed. The peritoneal catheter was removed. The peritoneal cavity was lavaged with copious amounts of saline solution. The patient developed intestinal fistula after the surgery. Parenteral nutrition, anti-infection treatment and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were applied. The patient died of septic shock 15 days later.

A 24 years old woman presented to ED with intermittent vague upper abdominal pain, nausea and malaise for 5 months. Her past history was only significant for obesity, for which she had an LAGB inserted over 4 years ago. Her blood tests on presentation revealed a white cell count of 8.46 109/L and a C-reactive protein of 28 mg/L with haemoglobin, platelets, electrolytes and liver enzymes all being within normal limits, as were her vitals. An abdominal examination revealed a focal tenderness over her periumbilical area and surrounding the well-healed LAGB port site. Computed tomography scan ( and ) showed an abnormal port position with soft tissue thickening seen surrounding the tube within the subcutaneous tissues of the abdominal wall and for a short distance within the abdomen and a segment of small bowel immediately deep to the entry. Findings were highly suspicious for a peritubal infection and/or a small-bowel perforation.\nThe patient was taken to theatre for a diagnostic laparoscopy where a loop of small bowel was found tethered to the anterior abdominal wall (). A decision was made for a local transverse incision over collection and the sinus tract was excised to find a small-bowel perforation around the RapidPort with an abscess cavity extending through the subcutaneous tissue to the skin. The bowel was run and no other areas of compromise were noted. Additionally, there was no evidence of soft tissue injury and the omentum appeared intact. The patient underwent a successful small-bowel resection and made an uneventful recovery. Histopathology confirmed a full-thickness defect in the resected small bowel segment with adjacent acute serositis.\nWe deduce that during the primary LABG insertion procedure, a loop of small bowel and its accompanying mesentery was unknowingly caught in the expandable prongs of the laparoscopic RapidPort () and hitched to the anterior abdominal wall. On the removal of this port, it appears that the segment of small bowel remained tethered with perforation contained within the abdominal wall.

A 56-year-old woman, a mother of 3 children, presented to the surgical department with a history of multiple neck lumps of 4 months duration. She also had generalised vague abdominal pain, loss of appetite and lower back pain. She had no significant medical, family or psychosocial history. Clinical examination revealed multiple, bilateral enlarged cervical lymph nodes which were firm to hard in consistency. Thyroid examination revealed a 2 × 2 cm firm lump on the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe. Examination of other lymph node groups revealed enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes. Abdominal examination and rectal examination were normal. Vaginal examination revealed a hard, unhealthy uterine cervix. Breast and axillary examination were unremarkable. She had spinal tenderness, but the neurological examination of the lower limbs was normal.\nHer basic blood investigations, liver profile and renal functions were within the normal limits. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound scan of the neck revealed multiple nodules in the thyroid, with increased vascularity, and multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes with obliterated fatty hila suggestive of malignant deposits. Contrast enhanced computed tomography of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis showed a mass in the uterine cervix (Fig. ) with multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the inguinal, iliac, para-aortic, anterior mediastinal and bilateral deep cervical groups (Fig. ). There were multiple low-density nodules in the thyroid gland (Fig. ). A mixed density mass lesion was also noted in the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe (Fig. ). Furthermore, an anterior wedge fracture of the L2 vertebra was seen, probably secondary to bone metastases.\nBiopsies from the uterine cervix and endometrial curettage revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, signifying local extension of the cervical carcinoma into the endometrium (Fig. ). Excision biopsy of a left cervical lymph node revealed metastatic deposits of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma similar to that of the uterine cervix (Fig. ). Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of intra-thyroid nodules revealed malignant squamous cells (Fig. ). This was followed by a panendoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract which yielded negative results.\nA multidisciplinary meeting with the oncologists, surgeon, gynaecologists, pathologists and radiologists was conducted. Considering the histopathological and imaging findings with negative panendoscopy, a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix metastasising to the cervical lymph nodes and thyroid gland was made. A decision was made to commence palliative chemoradiotherapy. After 6 months, the patient developed generalised body oedema. She was transferred to a specialised cancer treatment centre for further palliative management, where she passed away a short while later, due to acute renal failure secondary to ureteric obstruction.
