128470,"Our patient is a 42-year-old male who initially presented to our clinic with a 5-year history of intermittent right knee pain.His medical history was significant for gout, managed with allopurinol, and he had previously undergone a nephrectomy to treat chronic renal disease. He denied any prior trauma to his knee but has worked in an oil field for his entire adult life. He reported a 2-month history of acute worsening of his pain as well as catching and locking symptoms that preceded his initial orthopedic assessment. He presented to our emergency room before orthopedic assessment due to sudden onset of right knee pain; blood tests revealed a uric acid level of 7.4 (normal) and a knee aspiration by the emergency room physician showed the presence of negative birefringent crystals. Pre-operative clinical examination of his right knee examination was significant for an effusion with medial greater than lateral joint line tenderness to palpation. His active and passive range of motion was 20—°, limited by pain. He had pain medially with McMurray testing and was ligamentously stable. He had no palpable gouty tophi within the knee and there was no evidence to suggest gouty tophi present anywhere else on his body. Weight-bearing knee radiographs showed mild tricompartmental degenerative changes with osteophyte formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right knee displayed tears along the posterior horn of both menisci and mild thinning of the articular cartilage of the medial and lateral femoral condyles and mild osteophytoses. Given the patient's presentation and new onset of mechanical symptoms, a diagnosis of symptomatic meniscal tearing in the setting of chronic degenerative osteoarthritis was made. The possibility of a gout flare was also discussed but thought unlikely due to the combination of his new mechanical symptoms with a negative prior history of knee involvement. After counseling of management options was completed, a trial of conservative care was initiated. He was given a combined injection of a hyaluronic acid viscosupplementation and corticosteroid to treat his pain and inflammation and a guided course of physical therapy was started. Topical anti-inflammatory medication was also prescribed as oral NSAIDs were contraindicated post nephrectomy. At his 4-week follow-up appointment, he reported improvement in pain but was still experiencing mechanical symptoms and pain limiting his ability to adequately perform his job. His right knee examination showed improved range of motion but continued swelling and tenderness centered over the joint lines. At this point, the decision was made to proceed with arthroscopic treatment with the goal being to return him to full duty and normal activities. During routine arthroscopy, extensive gouty tophi were noted diffusely throughout the knee including widespread involvement of both femoral condyles and menisci. The meniscal lesions were on the surface of the menisci as well as within the meniscal tears (, , , , , ). Furthermore, noted were the expected posterior horn medial and lateral meniscal tears with tophaceous deposits within the tears. Partial meniscectomies were completed, followed by extensive debridement and excision of the tophi from the articular surface and menisciutilizing a standard arthroscopic shaver and a curved liberator typically used during shoulder arthroscopy. At his initial 10-day post-operative visit, he reported significant pain relief and resolution of his mechanical symptoms. Aggressive physical therapy was initiated as well as a rheumatology referral for medical management of his severe gouty arthritis. By his 6thweek after surgery, he had full range of motion compared to the contralateral side and his activity-related soreness was well-managed with over the counter analgesics, and he was returned to full duty at his job. At final follow-up at 3 months, he continued to have full range of motion with no pain or issues with while working his job in the oil field.","{'visit motivation': 'Intermittent right knee pain', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Sudden onset of right knee pain', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Emergency room before orthopedic assessment'}], 'patient information': {'age': '42', 'sex': 'male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'Oil field worker'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'History of gout, managed with allopurinol, and a nephrectomy for chronic renal disease', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Chronic renal disease', 'Type': 'Nephrectomy', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Knee pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'Acute worsening', 'location': 'Right knee', 'time': '5-year history, 2-month history of acute worsening', 'temporalisation': 'Intermittent', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Catching and locking symptoms', 'details': 'Denied any prior trauma to the knee'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Knee aspiration', 'result': 'Presence of negative birefringent crystals', 'details': 'Performed by the emergency room physician'}, {'name': 'Pre-operative clinical examination', 'result': 'Effusion with medial greater than lateral joint line tenderness, limited range of motion, pain with McMurray testing, ligamentous stability', 'details': 'No palpable gouty tophi within the knee'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Blood tests', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Uric acid level of 7.4 (normal)', 'condition': 'Gout', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Weight-bearing knee radiographs', 'severity': 'Mild', 'result': 'Tricompartmental degenerative changes with osteophyte formation', 'condition': 'Degenerative osteoarthritis', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'MRI of the right knee', 'severity': 'Mild', 'result': 'Tears along the posterior horn of both menisci, thinning of the articular cartilage of the medial and lateral femoral condyles, mild osteophytoses', 'condition': 'Symptomatic meniscal tearing, chronic degenerative osteoarthritis', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Conservative care', 'related condition': 'Symptomatic meniscal tearing, chronic degenerative osteoarthritis', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'New onset of mechanical symptoms', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'Combined injection of a hyaluronic acid viscosupplementation and corticosteroid'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[[""What is the motivation for the patient's visit?""], ['Does the note mention any drug usage?', 'Does the note mention any relevant physiological conditions (e.g., vital signs, weight, height)?', 'Does the note mention any relevant psychological conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression)?', ""Does the note mention the patient's alcohol consumption habits (e.g., frequency, amount)?"", 'Does the patient have any allergies to medications or other substances?', ""Does the note mention the patient's smoking history?

118221,"A 67-year-old man with a 40 pack-year smoking history initially presented with chills and a productive cough and was given antibiotics for presumed pneumonia. When his condition did not improve, a computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed and revealed a large right hilar mass with extensive mediastinal adenopathy as well as surrounding infiltrate and atelectasis. Bronchial brushings and a right hilar node FNA were consistent with SCLC. The remainder of the workup, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, was negative for distant metastatic disease, establishing a diagnosis of limited stage (LS) disease. His medical history was significant for numerous coexisting medical conditions including a remote history of suspected but unconfirmed connective tissue disorder (CREST), colitis, esophagitis, duodenitis, livedo reticularis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multinodular goiter, arthritis, glaucoma, hypertension, multifocal motor neuropathy and atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry tract for which he had undergone AV nodal ablation. Of note, neither the Hashimoto's nor CREST were active for multiple years leading up to his diagnosis of SCLC. The latter diagnosis had been suspected by the Rheumatology Service but after a negative workup, he was discharged from their clinic.\nAfter completion of staging, he was advised to undergo definitive chemoradiation. He was also advised to re-establish follow up with the Rheumatology Service, but declined. After a detailed discussion of the potential for increased risk of complications from radiation with an underlying connective tissue disorder, he elected to proceed. He was treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy to the right lung and mediastinum in 33 daily fractions of 200 cGy to a total dose of 6600 cGy with two cycles of concurrent cisplatin (cis) and etoposide. After 3000 cGy, another CT was performed to allow for decrease in treatment field after initial response. RT was completed in 8 wk and 1 d. A representative image from his intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) radiation plan is presented in (Figure ). His treatment course was complicated by pancytopenia (for which he received filgrastim and one unit of packed red blood cells), as well as dysphagia and odynophagia. He received two cycles of chemotherapy during the radiation and two cycles in the adjuvant setting after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy, though the last three cycles were dose-reduced because of hematologic toxicities. During chemotherapy he was treated for clostridium difficile colitis and was briefly admitted for generalized weakness. Approximately three months after completion of thoracic RT, he received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) which was given as 10 fractions of 250 cGy.\nDuring PCI, he required admission due to inability to tolerate daily travel. Shortly after completion of PCI he developed recurrent clostridium difficile colitis and within weeks of completion of PCI he was readmitted and remained hospitalized for two months. While admitted, he experienced episodes of hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring repeated use of a nonrebreather and for which he underwent intubation twice. Chest imaging demonstrated development of worsening bilateral interstitial and airspace opacities (Figure ). He was aggressively treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and high dose steroids. Eventually he developed tachycardia, respiratory distress, hypotension and suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation. In accordance with his family's wishes he underwent palliate extubation and expired shortly thereafter.\nAn autopsy was performed and the report described extensive, diffuse, bilateral alveolar damage consistent with post-radiation changes, as well as small cell carcinoma in multiple foci within septal capillaries and contiguous alveolar spaces.","{'visit motivation': 'Initially presented with chills and a productive cough', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Presumed pneumonia, later diagnosed with SCLC', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '67', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': ""Suspected but unconfirmed connective tissue disorder (CREST), colitis, esophagitis, duodenitis, livedo reticularis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multinodular goiter, arthritis, glaucoma, hypertension, multifocal motor neuropathy, atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry tract, AV nodal ablation"", 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': '40 pack-year smoking history'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry tract', 'Type': 'AV nodal ablation', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Chills, productive cough', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Condition did not improve with antibiotics'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Computed tomography (CT) of the chest', 'result': 'Large right hilar mass with extensive mediastinal adenopathy, surrounding infiltrate and atelectasis', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Bronchial brushings and right hilar node FNA', 'result': 'Consistent with SCLC', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Brain MRI, bone scan, PET-CT', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Negative for distant metastatic disease', 'condition': 'Limited stage (LS) SCLC', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Definitive chemoradiation', 'related condition': 'Limited stage (LS) SCLC', 'dosage': 'Intensity modulated radiation therapy to the right lung and mediastinum in 33 daily fractions of 200 cGy to a total dose of 6600 cGy with two cycles of concurrent cisplatin (cis) and etoposide', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'Daily', 'duration': 'Completed in 8 weeks and 1 day', 'reason for taking': 'To treat SCLC', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'Another CT after 3000 cGy to allow for decrease in treatment field after initial response'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'Advised to re-establish follow up with the Rheumatology Service, but declined', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Are there any specific details mentioned about the surgical procedure or complications?', 'When was the surgery performed?', 'What was the outcome of the surgery (e.g., successful, complications)?', 'What was the reason for the surgery?', 'What type of surgery was performed?'], [""What are the patient's main symptoms or concerns upon admission?"", 'Did the patient travel recently, and could it be relevant to the current condition?

92394,"A 13-year-old Caucasian boy presented with acute appendicitis, characterized by right lower quadrant pain. He underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy, and a pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of focal acute appendicitis. No intra-abdominal masses were noted at the time of surgery. However, after the operation, the patient experienced persistent drainage of serosanginous fluid from a trochar site. Once this drainage ceased, the patient was discharged home ten days after admission.\nDuring the next six months he continued to experience intermittent abdominal pain, which led to representation to the emergency room. Additionally, the patient experienced an increase in abdominal girth, abdominal pain, and weight loss. No constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or jaundice was reported. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 23 by 12.5 cm fatty soft tissue mass surrounded by mesenteric fat (Figure ). The tumor encased branches of the superior mesenteric artery and displaced the small bowel. Multiple fluid collections were also seen in the right lower quadrant. A subsequent CT-guided biopsy suggested a benign fatty tumor; the differential diagnosis included lymphangioma, lipoma and fibrolipoma. The patient was then transferred to our institution for definitive care.\nA physical examination of the patient revealed that his vital signs were within normal limits and that his abdomen was distended with a large palpable mass extending from the left flank to the right semilunar line. A large part of the bowel appeared to be displaced in the right abdomen, and the presence of shifting dullness suggested ascites.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room where a diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed a large intra-abdominal tumor arising from the mesentery and a significant amount of free chylous fluid. The tumor adhered to the duodenum and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and vein (SMV). A frozen biopsy performed during the operation suggested that the mass was a lymphatic vascular malformation with a fibrous stroma and fibrous capsule consistent with a benign tumor. The operation was converted to a midline laparotomy for tumor resection. As mentioned earlier, the tumor was largely entangled with the mesentery. However, a circumferential dissection was performed through the creation of a plane between the tumor and mesentery. The SMA, the third and fourth portions of the duodenum, and the proximal small bowel were each affixed to the tumor but were successfully dissected off. The tumor was excised along with 50 cm of small bowel, and a primary anastamosis was performed (Figure ).

A 13-year-old Caucasian boy presented with acute appendicitis, characterized by right lower quadrant pain. He underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy, and a pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of focal acute appendicitis. No intra-abdominal masses were noted at the time of surgery. However, after the operation, the patient experienced persistent drainage of serosanginous fluid from a trochar site. Once this drainage ceased, the patient was discharged home ten days after admission.\nDuring the next six months he continued to experience intermittent abdominal pain, which led to representation to the emergency room. Additionally, the patient experienced an increase in abdominal girth, abdominal pain, and weight loss. No constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or jaundice was reported. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 23 by 12.5 cm fatty soft tissue mass surrounded by mesenteric fat (Figure ). The tumor encased branches of the superior mesenteric artery and displaced the small bowel. Multiple fluid collections were also seen in the right lower quadrant. A subsequent CT-guided biopsy suggested a benign fatty tumor; the differential diagnosis included lymphangioma, lipoma and fibrolipoma. The patient was then transferred to our institution for definitive care.\nA physical examination of the patient revealed that his vital signs were within normal limits and that his abdomen was distended with a large palpable mass extending from the left flank to the right semilunar line. A large part of the bowel appeared to be displaced in the right abdomen, and the presence of shifting dullness suggested ascites.\nThe patient was taken to the operating room where a diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed a large intra-abdominal tumor arising from the mesentery and a significant amount of free chylous fluid. The tumor adhered to the duodenum and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and vein (SMV). A frozen biopsy performed during the operation suggested that the mass was a lymphatic vascular malformation with a fibrous stroma and fibrous capsule consistent with a benign tumor. The operation was converted to a midline laparotomy for tumor resection. As mentioned earlier, the tumor was largely entangled with the mesentery. However, a circumferential dissection was performed through the creation of a plane between the tumor and mesentery. The SMA, the third and fourth portions of the duodenum, and the proximal small bowel were each affixed to the tumor but were successfully dissected off. The tumor was excised along with 50 cm of small bowel, and a primary anastamosis was performed (Figure ). The final pathology demonstrated a 27.5-cm lymphatic malformation with no evidence of malignancy (Figure ); the ascitic fluid aspiration was deemed to be chylous ascites. The patient recovered well and was discharged home eight days after the operation. At a follow-up visit six months after the operation, the patient is doing well and tolerating full oral feeding, with complete resolution of his abdominal complaints.

163777,"A 51-years old man presented with a clinical diagnosis of multinodular goiter. The patient did not show evidence of autoimmune disorders or thyroiditis and the thyroid function was normal. He was referred to surgery and complete thyroidectomy with intraoperative histological examination was performed. The thyroid was enlarged with a weight of 55 g, measuring 5×4.5×4.5 cm in the right lobe and 5×3×3 cm in the left lobe. Macroscopically, the right lobe harboured a cystic-colloid hemorrhagic nodule 2.5 cm diameter while two colloid nodules of 2 cm and 3 cm respectively, were found in the left lobe. All of the aforementioned nodular lesions were examined intraoperatively. The cystic nodule in the right lobe showed a diffuse papillary architecture with slight overlapping and enlarged nuclei; as a consequence an intraoperative histological diagnosis of suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma/papillary hyperplasia with atypia, was posed. The two nodules in the left lobe were considered benign, although one of them also showed cystic aspects with papillary architecture. The lesions were finally sampled, formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for the final histological evaluation. Microscopically two colloid-cystic nodules showed papillary structures with a delicate stroma and prominent intralesional mature fat (). Furthermore, the nodule in the right thyroid lobe showed cytological features suspicious for PTC. The nuclei in fact were sometimes enlarged, with scattered grooves, overlapping and clearing, but no nuclear pseudoinclusion or psammomabodies were found (). The lesion did not show a complete capsule and merged with the surrounding thyroid tissue. Neither mitotic figures nor necrosis were found. In the left nodule the nuclei were basally located with dark chromatin without atypical features. To exclude the diagnosis of a PTC and to better categorize these lesions, the expression of two well known thyroid cancer associated antigens namely Galectin-3 (Gal-3) and HBME-1 was evaluated by using immunohistochemical procedures. A biotin-free immunoperoxidase detection system was applied, and foamy macrophages were considered as internal positive control for Gal-3 immunostaining. The left nodule showed a faint and focal cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for Gal-3 (data not shown), while the suspicious lesion in the right thyroid lobe showed a variable immunoreactivity for Gal-3 with nuclear and cytoplasmatic pattern of staining. Interestingly galectin-3 expression was restricted to those cells showing atypical cytological features whereas HBME-1 immunostaining further highlighted the plasma membrane aspect of these atypical cells ( and ) However the larger part of the papillary lesion was unreactive with both Galectin-3 and HBME-1. On the basis of the morphological and immunophenotypical analysis we classified the lesion as an adenomatous nodule with fat-rich stroma and papillary atypical hyperplasia, with focal expression of Galectin-3 and HBME-1 reflecting an incipient transformation in PTC. To exclude the presence of a PTC, we carefully examined the rest of the thyroid for a total of 28 slides.","{'visit motivation': 'Clinical diagnosis of multinodular goiter', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Referred to surgery for multinodular goiter', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '51-years old', 'sex': 'man', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'No evidence of autoimmune disorders or thyroiditis, normal thyroid function', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Multinodular goiter', 'Type': 'Complete thyroidectomy with intraoperative histological examination', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Intraoperative histological diagnosis of suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma/papillary hyperplasia with atypia in the right lobe; benign nodules in the left lobe', 'details': 'Thyroid enlarged, weight 55 g, right lobe measuring 5×4.5×4.5 cm with a cystic-colloid hemorrhagic nodule 2.5 cm diameter; left lobe measuring 5×3×3 cm with two colloid nodules of 2 cm and 3 cm respectively'}], 'symptoms': 'None', 'medical examinations': 'None', 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Intraoperative histological examination', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma/papillary hyperplasia with atypia in the right lobe; benign nodules in the left lobe', 'condition': 'Suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma/papillary hyperplasia with atypia', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Cystic nodule in the right lobe showed diffuse papillary architecture with slight overlapping and enlarged nuclei; left lobe nodules considered benign, one with cystic aspects and papillary architecture'}, {'test': 'Immunohistochemical procedures', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Evaluation of Galectin-3 (Gal-3) and HBME-1 expression', 'condition': 'To exclude the diagnosis of a PTC and to better categorize the lesions', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'A biotin-free immunoperoxidase detection system was applied, and foamy macrophages were considered as internal positive control'}], 'treatments': 'None', 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What diagnostic test(s) were performed?', 'What were the results of the test (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'Does the note indicate the severity of the condition based on the test results?', 'What medical condition was the test intended to diagnose or investigate?', 'When was the test performed?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the test results (e.g., specific values, interpretations)?'], [""What is the patient's sex assigned at birth?"", ""What are the patient's main symptoms or concerns upon admission?"", 'Does the note mention any significant family history of medical conditions?', 'Does the note mention any relevant past medical conditions (e.g., surgeries, chronic illnesses)?', ""What is the patient's ethnicity?

132520,"A 68-year-old right-handed man with an educational background of a high school diploma had visited the hospital due to weakness in the bilateral upper limbs and lower limbs, decreased sensation of lower extremities and dysuria occurred 5 days ago as main complaints. Due to decreased vision of the left eye, which had occurred seven years ago, and decreased vision of the right eye occurring 2 months before visiting the hospital, he was diagnosed as optic neuritis and received a steroid treatment from other hospital. He had discontinued the medication and was under prognostic observation. The vision in both of his eyes at the time of visiting the hospital were decreased but still he was able to distinguish shapes or colors of all objects.\nHis consciousness was clear, and eye movements, facial symmetry and sensory functions were normal other than the existing sight disorder. The muscular strength of extremities showed MRC grade III in the right upper limb, grade IV in the left upper limb, and grade IV in both lower limbs. When conducting the sensory test, there were slightly degraded pain senses, vibration senses, tactile senses and location senses below T4 skin fragments. He showed a positive response to Lhermitte's sign where the patient has sensations of electrical current flowing through his bilateral arms when suddenly flexing his head forward. The deep tendon reflexes of extremities were all normal, and both sides showed negative responses to the Babinski reflex. As abdominal distention was observed, 1000 cc of urine was drained after insertion of a urinary catheter.\nDuring the spinal magnetic resonance imaging (spine MRI), a high intensity signal of T2 was shown from C1-T8 spine () and the findings from the brain MRI were normal.

A 68-year-old right-handed man with an educational background of a high school diploma had visited the hospital due to weakness in the bilateral upper limbs and lower limbs, decreased sensation of lower extremities and dysuria occurred 5 days ago as main complaints. Due to decreased vision of the left eye, which had occurred seven years ago, and decreased vision of the right eye occurring 2 months before visiting the hospital, he was diagnosed as optic neuritis and received a steroid treatment from other hospital. He had discontinued the medication and was under prognostic observation. The vision in both of his eyes at the time of visiting the hospital were decreased but still he was able to distinguish shapes or colors of all objects.\nHis consciousness was clear, and eye movements, facial symmetry and sensory functions were normal other than the existing sight disorder. The muscular strength of extremities showed MRC grade III in the right upper limb, grade IV in the left upper limb, and grade IV in both lower limbs. When conducting the sensory test, there were slightly degraded pain senses, vibration senses, tactile senses and location senses below T4 skin fragments. He showed a positive response to Lhermitte's sign where the patient has sensations of electrical current flowing through his bilateral arms when suddenly flexing his head forward. The deep tendon reflexes of extremities were all normal, and both sides showed negative responses to the Babinski reflex. As abdominal distention was observed, 1000 cc of urine was drained after insertion of a urinary catheter.\nDuring the spinal magnetic resonance imaging (spine MRI), a high intensity signal of T2 was shown from C1-T8 spine () and the findings from the brain MRI were normal. The number of cells, the chemical values and IgG index were normal in the cerebrospinal fluid tests, whereas the oligoclonal band was negative also.\nThe visual evoked potential test showed poor waveforms from both sides, whereas the left posterior tibial nerve sensory evoked a potential test among the somatosensory evoked potential test showing an abnormality reasonable for central nerve conduction disorder, and the auditory evoked potential test results were normal. Basic blood tests, urinalysis, vasculitis test and thyroid function tests were all normal and from the autoimmune antibody test, it showed positive response to the AQP4 antibody.\nAs the guardian commented that the patient is gradually speaking less, has a reduction of interest in hobby activities, and has character and behavioral changes such as being unable to control his appetite and becoming furious to insignificant matter, we conducted the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery for additional evaluation.

152810,"A 48-year-old woman with hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, seasonal allergies, and long-standing solid food dysphagia presented to our gastroenterology clinic with progressively worsening dysphagia and transient food impaction. The patient reported approximately 7 years of solid food dysphagia, but prior to this, has had no upper gastrointestinal symptoms, trouble swallowing, or dietary modification. She had sought prior gastrointestinal evaluation, and an endoscopy 2 years after symptom onset showed rings and furrows, but biopsies were not obtained and dilation was not performed. Though no specific treatments were initiated, the patient did note an improvement in her ability to swallow following the procedure.\nOne year prior to her presentation, she developed recurrent solid dysphagia which progressively worsened. Solid foods, particularly bread and meat, would get stuck in the upper chest and resulted in transient impactions 2–3 times per week. In most instances, if she waited, the food would ultimately pass; however, in some cases, she would have to regurgitate the food. She reported eating slowly, taking small bites, chewing thoroughly, and drinking a lot of liquids during meals. Because of suspicion of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), she was placed on a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole 20 mg twice daily), and repeat endoscopy was performed. She was given propofol for sedation, and the endoscopy went smoothly, but it was noted that she was yawning multiple times during the procedure.\nImmediately after the procedure, the patient experienced severe left-sided facial pain. On examination, there was a spasm over the left masseter muscle, and she was unable to close her mouth. In an attempt to control her pain and relax her muscle spasm, the patient was given 25 μg of fentanyl and a 30-mg dose of propofol, but these were not successful. Given the severity of her pain and her inability to close her mouth, she was referred to the emergency department for suspicion of jaw dislocation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient required additional doses of fentanyl for pain control. A maxillofacial CT showed an anterior dislocation of the left TMJ without a mandibular fracture (fig. , ). The initial attempt at jaw reduction using a 2-mg intravenous dose of midazolam sedation was unsuccessful. The oral maxillofacial surgery team was consulted and successfully reduced the jaw dislocation following administration of a 100-mg dose of ketamine. She received a jaw strap and was discharged home. She remained in the jaw strap and on a mechanical soft diet for 7 days. She was closely followed over the next several days and rapidly improved to her baseline. Further history was obtained and while she has had no prior jaw dislocation, she did report intermittent jaw pain. Of note, the results of the biopsy from her endoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of EoE, which will require the patient to undergo future endoscopies.","{'visit motivation': 'Progressively worsening dysphagia and transient food impaction', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Severe left-sided facial pain and inability to close mouth, suspicion of jaw dislocation', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Emergency department'}], 'patient information': {'age': '48', 'sex': 'Woman', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, seasonal allergies, long-standing solid food dysphagia', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'Seasonal allergies', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Dysphagia', 'intensity of symptom': 'Progressively worsening', 'location': 'Upper chest', 'time': 'Approximately 7 years of solid food dysphagia, recurrent solid dysphagia developed one year prior to presentation', 'temporalisation': 'Transient impactions 2–3 times per week', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Eating slowly, taking small bites, chewing thoroughly, drinking a lot of liquids', 'details': 'Solid foods, particularly bread and meat, would get stuck resulting in transient impactions'}, {'name of symptom': 'Severe left-sided facial pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'Severe', 'location': 'Left side of face', 'time': 'Immediately after the endoscopy procedure', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Spasm over the left masseter muscle, unable to close mouth'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Endoscopy', 'result': 'Showed rings and furrows', 'details': 'Biopsies were not obtained and dilation was not performed during the first endoscopy 2 years after symptom onset'}, {'name': 'Repeat endoscopy', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Patient was yawning multiple times during the procedure; performed because of suspicion of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)'}, {'name': 'Examination for facial pain', 'result': 'Spasm over the left masseter muscle, unable to close mouth', 'details': 'Occurred immediately after the endoscopy procedure'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Proton pump inhibitor', 'related condition': 'Suspicion of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)', 'dosage': 'Omeprazole 20 mg', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'Twice daily', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To treat suspected EoE', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Sedation for endoscopy', 'related condition': 'Endoscopy procedure', 'dosage': 'Propofol', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To perform endoscopy', 'reaction to treatment': 'Yawning multiple times during the procedure', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Pain and muscle spasm management', 'related condition': 'Severe left-sided facial pain and muscle spasm', 'dosage': '25 μg of fentanyl and a 30-mg dose of propofol', 'time': 'Immediately after the endoscopy procedure', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To control pain and relax muscle spasm', 'reaction to treatment': 'Not successful', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Where was the patient admitted (e.g., hospital name, department)?', ""What is the primary reason for the patient's admission?"", 'What is the date the patient was admitted?', 'How long did the patient stay in the care center?

181773,"A 16-year-old male patient was brought by his parents to a genetics clinic with complaints of developmental delay and tremor. He was a full-term infant with an uneventful delivery. He started walking around 18 months of age, spoke his first words at the age of two. Other problems included nervousness, immature behaviors, lack of eye contact during conversations, and aggressive behavior. His mother reported that he began to have a tremor in the hands around three years of age. Diagnostic workup included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, urine organic and amino acids, lactate, pyruvate, and lead levels along with chromosomal and DNA analysis for fragile X which were all unremarkable. His family history was significant for mental retardation. Maternal grandmother had three mentally retarded brothers with tremors, two of whom died in their forties. The patient's brother also seems to have a speech delay along with tremors since the age of three.\nHis tremors worsened gradually, and he started to have difficulties with fine motor control including difficulty with drinking out of a cup along with increased aggression and behavioral changes. His teachers reported that he was biting, kicking, spitting and getting into conflicts with other children. He was seen by a child psychiatrist at that time and was started on risperidone, valproic acid and Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) which seemed to help with his behaviors.\nOn examination, he has high nasal bridge, slightly down-slanting palpebral fissures, long philtrum, and thin upper lip. On neurological exam, he has slightly increased deep tendon reflexes throughout. Babinski sign was positive on the right, but a normal plantar response was noted on the left side. Bilateral hand tremors were noted, both at rest and in action. He was walking slowly without much arm swing and had a slightly stooped forward posture. A full psychological evaluation was done which showed a Leiter scale IQ of 91. The Vineland adaptive behavior scale showed functioning at the 19-month level. On the childhood autism rating scale (CARS) he scored 31 to 32, consistent with mild autism.

A 16-year-old male patient was brought by his parents to a genetics clinic with complaints of developmental delay and tremor. He was a full-term infant with an uneventful delivery. He started walking around 18 months of age, spoke his first words at the age of two. Other problems included nervousness, immature behaviors, lack of eye contact during conversations, and aggressive behavior. His mother reported that he began to have a tremor in the hands around three years of age. Diagnostic workup included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, urine organic and amino acids, lactate, pyruvate, and lead levels along with chromosomal and DNA analysis for fragile X which were all unremarkable. His family history was significant for mental retardation. Maternal grandmother had three mentally retarded brothers with tremors, two of whom died in their forties. The patient's brother also seems to have a speech delay along with tremors since the age of three.\nHis tremors worsened gradually, and he started to have difficulties with fine motor control including difficulty with drinking out of a cup along with increased aggression and behavioral changes. His teachers reported that he was biting, kicking, spitting and getting into conflicts with other children. He was seen by a child psychiatrist at that time and was started on risperidone, valproic acid and Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) which seemed to help with his behaviors.\nOn examination, he has high nasal bridge, slightly down-slanting palpebral fissures, long philtrum, and thin upper lip. On neurological exam, he has slightly increased deep tendon reflexes throughout. Babinski sign was positive on the right, but a normal plantar response was noted on the left side. Bilateral hand tremors were noted, both at rest and in action. He was walking slowly without much arm swing and had a slightly stooped forward posture. A full psychological evaluation was done which showed a Leiter scale IQ of 91. The Vineland adaptive behavior scale showed functioning at the 19-month level. On the childhood autism rating scale (CARS) he scored 31 to 32, consistent with mild autism. He was enrolled in a special education program and speech therapy.\nGenetic testing was ordered in both the patient and his brother that was positive for a Rett syndrome methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) mutation, A140V in both the boys.

163332,"A 22 year old female presented with discharging sinuses and swelling over the right arm of 18 months duration. She received courses of antibiotics at a local clinic. The nodulo-ulcerative discharging sinuses were initially small sized but failed to heal and continued to increase in size. On local examination multiple crater like ulcers with few papulo-pustular lesions on the dorso-lateral aspect of the lower two-third of right arm were seen []. The ulcer had indurated margin surrounded by a zone of hyperpigmentation with mild seropurulent discharge and crust formation at the base of the ulcer [Figrue 2]. Features of eczematization were seen on the surrounding margins of the ulcer. There was local rise of temperature on the overlying skin. No regional lymphadenopathy was detected. Systemic examination did not reveal any abnormalities. There was no history of recent loss of weight and night sweats. There was no history of trauma or immune suppressive therapy. But the family history revealed a treated case of pulmonary tuberculosis in one of the family members. Routine investigations showed normal blood counts with raised Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) which was 58 mm/after 1 hr and raised C-reactive protein (CRP). Routine urine tests and blood biochemistry were within normal limits. HIV, VDRL tests were negative and Mantoux test showed positive reaction. Primary staining of discharge was negative for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. Skin biopsy from the lesion was subjected to culture on LJ media and histopathological examination. On culture there was yellowish, rough colony which grew after 21 days of inoculation which was confirmed as Mycobacterium tuberculosis by PCR []. Histopathology study of skin biopsy revealed epithelioid granuloma with inflammatory cell infiltrates in the dermis []. The chest X-ray of anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral view showed no infiltration. X-ray of the right humerus AP/lateral view showed features of periosteal reaction with new bone formation and soft tissue showed irregular radiolucent areas in the margin [].

88019,"A 72-year-old woman presented to our clinic having nonspecific dyspeptic disturbances and mild pain in the epigastrium. She had no other symptoms and was free from any underlying disease. The patient had a medical history that included thyroidectomy (5 months earlier), tumor excision of her left breast (2 years earlier), and cholecystectomy and appendectomy (both more than 10 years earlier). The patient had an unremarkable family history and was not taking any medications. Other pertinent details from her medical history were that she was allergic to an unknown antibiotic and she did not smoke or drink alcohol. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness at the epigastrium and left hypochondrium and mild tenderness at her left breast, but no other signs. The patient was completely fit, and her vital signs and laboratory examinations (including tumor marker tests) were all within normal ranges. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed a 3 cm, well-demarcated, enhanced mass in the tail of the pancreas (Figures and ).\nShe had no other imaging exams, and she was scheduled for surgery with the suspicion that the tumor was a nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Intraoperatively, a well-encapsulated mass was recognized at the tail of the pancreas and distal pancreatectomy without splenectomy was performed by laparotomy. The patient's recovery was complicated by a pancreatic fistula that lasted for ten days and resolved spontaneously with conservative treatment. The patient had no other events, and she was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day.\nHistological examination demonstrated a solid serous adenoma of the pancreas. Gross examination showed a well-demarcated tumor. Microscopic examination of the neoplasm showed a tumor with well-defined borders with a fibrous capsule () that consisted of clear cells located in solid nests with a few tubules (). The solid nests had round nuclei and were without atypia, mitoses, or necrosis ().\nThe adjacent pancreatic tissue was completely normal, and invasion of the capsule was not discovered in any tumor specimens. Immunohistochemical examination revealed cells positive for each of the following: Cytokeratin-7 (), Cytokeratin-8/Cytokeratin-18 (), neurospecific enolase (NSE) (), and intracytoplasmic periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) (). All cells were negative for vimentin ().\nConsidering all these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a solid serous adenoma of the pancreas.

A 72-year-old woman presented to our clinic having nonspecific dyspeptic disturbances and mild pain in the epigastrium. She had no other symptoms and was free from any underlying disease. The patient had a medical history that included thyroidectomy (5 months earlier), tumor excision of her left breast (2 years earlier), and cholecystectomy and appendectomy (both more than 10 years earlier). The patient had an unremarkable family history and was not taking any medications. Other pertinent details from her medical history were that she was allergic to an unknown antibiotic and she did not smoke or drink alcohol. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness at the epigastrium and left hypochondrium and mild tenderness at her left breast, but no other signs. The patient was completely fit, and her vital signs and laboratory examinations (including tumor marker tests) were all within normal ranges. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed a 3 cm, well-demarcated, enhanced mass in the tail of the pancreas (Figures and ).\nShe had no other imaging exams, and she was scheduled for surgery with the suspicion that the tumor was a nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Intraoperatively, a well-encapsulated mass was recognized at the tail of the pancreas and distal pancreatectomy without splenectomy was performed by laparotomy. The patient's recovery was complicated by a pancreatic fistula that lasted for ten days and resolved spontaneously with conservative treatment. The patient had no other events, and she was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day.\nHistological examination demonstrated a solid serous adenoma of the pancreas. Gross examination showed a well-demarcated tumor. Microscopic examination of the neoplasm showed a tumor with well-defined borders with a fibrous capsule () that consisted of clear cells located in solid nests with a few tubules (). The solid nests had round nuclei and were without atypia, mitoses, or necrosis ().\nThe adjacent pancreatic tissue was completely normal, and invasion of the capsule was not discovered in any tumor specimens. Immunohistochemical examination revealed cells positive for each of the following: Cytokeratin-7 (), Cytokeratin-8/Cytokeratin-18 (), neurospecific enolase (NSE) (), and intracytoplasmic periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) (). All cells were negative for vimentin ().\nConsidering all these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a solid serous adenoma of the pancreas. The patient was followed up one month and six months postoperatively, and we observed that she has recovered completely and remains disease-free.

118535,"A 61-year-old female presented to our hospital complaining of gross hematuria with palpable left flank mass. Initial laboratory data revealed severe anemia, hypercalcemia, and elevated CRP indicating poor risk according to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria (). The patient had hypervasucular tumor at the left kidney measuring 13 cm in diameter with long venous extension to the suprahepatic IVC () and left gonadal vein (). In addition, metastases were observed in lungs and hilar lymph nodes (). Initially, indication of the nephrectomy was questionable; however, we confirmed that metastases were controllable by presurgical axitinib treatment. Therefore, we considered surgical intervention. After the patient was placed in the lateral position, we began the procedure by laparoscopy to mobilize the spleen, pancreas tail, and descending colon and ligate the left renal artery. Next, we adjusted the patient to the supine position, and open surgical intervention was performed through inverted T incision to the upper abdomen. IVC and bilateral renal veins were exposed, and the liver was mobilized to expose retrohepatic IVC. As the tumor extension in this case advanced to level III, IVC was secured under the diaphragm, and Pringle maneuver was performed. Under clamping of the right renal vein, hepatoduodenal ligament and IVC (under diaphragm and caudal part to the termination of the right renal vein), a small incision was performed to the anterior surface of IVC; however, we encountered uncontrollable bleeding. Accordingly, we closed the IVC scar, and de-clamped (clamping time was 5 minutes). The segmental resection of infrahepatic IVC is necessary, which, however, would significantly increase the difficulty of reconstruction following removal. For this reason, we performed CPB with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). We performed midline sternotomy in preparation for cannulation to superior vena cava (SVC) and left ventricles to establish CPB and to commence active cooling toward 20°C. After initiation of DHCA, IVC was segmentally dissected along with tumor thrombus. Tumor thrombus was covered by latex material and carefully removed by passing it under the superior mesenchymal artery. The left kidney was then extracted completely. The reconstruction of IVC was accomplished with bovine pericardium patch. CPB was reinstituted and re-warming was started. Once normothermia was achieved, the patient was weaned from CPB and decannulated. After ensuring hemostasis, operative scars were closed in ordinary fashion. On the second day post-surgery, the patient complained of dyspnea, which was caused by increased pleural effusion from metastasis. We inserted a drainage tube, which improved the patient's condition. The TKI treatment was initiated 1 month after surgery and has maintained stable disease for 3 months.","{'visit motivation': 'Complaining of gross hematuria with palpable left flank mass', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Severe anemia, hypercalcemia, elevated CRP, and presence of hypervascular tumor with metastases', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '61', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'None', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Hypervascular tumor at the left kidney with venous extension and metastases', 'Type': 'Presurgical axitinib treatment followed by laparoscopy and open surgical intervention with CPB and DHCA', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Encountered uncontrollable bleeding during surgery', 'details': 'Mobilization of spleen, pancreas tail, and descending colon; ligation of left renal artery; IVC and bilateral renal veins exposure; liver mobilization; securing IVC under the diaphragm; Pringle maneuver; clamping of right renal vein, hepatoduodenal ligament and IVC; incision to anterior surface of IVC; closure of IVC scar; segmental resection of infrahepatic IVC; CPB with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest; midline sternotomy for cannulation to SVC and left ventricles; active cooling toward 20°C; segmental dissection of IVC with tumor thrombus'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Gross hematuria', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Left flank', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Palpable left flank mass'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Initial laboratory data', 'result': 'Severe anemia, hypercalcemia, elevated CRP', 'details': 'Poor risk according to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria'}, {'name': 'Imaging', 'result': 'Hypervascular tumor at the left kidney measuring 13 cm in diameter with long venous extension to the suprahepatic IVC and left gonadal vein; metastases in lungs and hilar lymph nodes', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'Poor risk', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'Hypervascular tumor at the left kidney with metastases', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Presurgical axitinib treatment', 'related condition': 'Hypervascular tumor at the left kidney with metastases', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To control metastases before surgical intervention', 'reaction to treatment': 'Metastases were controllable', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[[""Does the note mention the patient's smoking history?

183302,"A 50-year-old Caucasian female, with no previous smoking history or pancreatic cancer family history, presented to our clinic for surgical evaluation of a biopsy-proven PDA noted at the junction of the body and tail of the pancreas. The patient had previously undergone a classic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) procedure with concurrent hemicolectomy 6 years prior (in 2011) for a T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head that had invaded the mesentery of the proximal transverse colon. After the 2011 surgery, pathology revealed a poorly differentiated PDA along with a PanIN grade 2. The final pathology showed negative surgical margins, positive perineural spread, and 0/33 specimen lymph node involvement. From June 2012 to October 2012, the patient underwent and completed adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine, capecitabine, and radiation at an outside hospital. She was carefully followed by her medical oncology team with serial CA 19-9 monitoring and abdominal MRIs on an ongoing basis. Due to her young age, in 2011, she underwent genetic screening and no germline mutations were identified. Since the time of the primary resection, the patient had been high functioning and healthy, with the exception of some problems of early satiety and recurrent cholangitis. These sequelae were attributed to close proximity of the gastrojejunostomy and hepaticojejunostomy, with possible reflux of intestinal contents up the afferent limb, all partially managed by diet changes.\nIn 2017, a biannual screening MRI with intravenous contrast showed a new pancreatic lesion measuring 2.3 × 2.2 cm in the tail of the pancreas (). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy identified it as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. From 2011 to 2017, she had had close followup with serial CA 19-9, and a measurement of this marker after identification of the lesion on MRI showed an elevation, which was confirmed on repeat testing (61 and 55 U/mL; normal <37 U/mL). This was the first instance of two consecutive CA 19-9 measurements outside of the normal range since resection of the primary cancer 6 years prior. When the patient presented to our institution a few months later, the CA 19-9 had returned to normal at 32 U/mL (), and there was a moderate increase in CEA (16.9 ng/mL; normal <3 ng/mL). The patient received a second MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast to identify distant disease, which showed the lesion to be confined to the pancreas. Along with the MRI of the abdomen, a CT of the chest was preformed, which showed no gross metastatic lesions. A completion pancreatectomy was scheduled with revision and lengthening of the jejunal limb proximal to the gastrojejunostomy to resect the tumor and treat her episodes of early satiety and recurrent cholangitis.\nIntraoperatively, the patient's three Whipple anastomoses were noted to be grossly intact and there was no evidence of metastatic disease. First, the stomach was divided approximately two centimeters proximal to the prior gastrojejunostomy. The jejunostomy was closed, and gastrocolic and gastrosplenic ligaments were divided. The splenic artery was ligated, and the splenocolic ligament was divided. The spleen and pancreas were mobilized out of the retroperitoneum. The jejunum was divided between the pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) and hepaticojejunostomy. The proximal jejunum, prior PJ, remaining pancreas, and spleen were removed. The tumor was noted to be grossly confined to the pancreas. The distal end of the stomach was delivered through the mesocolon and a retrocolic gastrojejunostomy was undertaken 60 cm downstream from the hepaticojejunostomy. The anatomy before and after this operation is shown in .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and had an uncomplicated hospital course. The patient was closely followed postoperatively and did well. She completed two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine from January 2018 to April 2018, but did have some neutropenia at the end of her adjuvant therapy requiring pegfilgrastim. Her intermittent fevers, early satiety, and abdominal pain resolved after the surgery. She became an obligate insulin-dependent diabetic after the completion pancreatectomy procedure and now requires exogenous pancreatic enzymes to support her nutrient absorption.\nThe specimen was found to be consistent with a poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.

A 50-year-old Caucasian female, with no previous smoking history or pancreatic cancer family history, presented to our clinic for surgical evaluation of a biopsy-proven PDA noted at the junction of the body and tail of the pancreas. The patient had previously undergone a classic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) procedure with concurrent hemicolectomy 6 years prior (in 2011) for a T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head that had invaded the mesentery of the proximal transverse colon. After the 2011 surgery, pathology revealed a poorly differentiated PDA along with a PanIN grade 2. The final pathology showed negative surgical margins, positive perineural spread, and 0/33 specimen lymph node involvement. From June 2012 to October 2012, the patient underwent and completed adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine, capecitabine, and radiation at an outside hospital. She was carefully followed by her medical oncology team with serial CA 19-9 monitoring and abdominal MRIs on an ongoing basis. Due to her young age, in 2011, she underwent genetic screening and no germline mutations were identified. Since the time of the primary resection, the patient had been high functioning and healthy, with the exception of some problems of early satiety and recurrent cholangitis. These sequelae were attributed to close proximity of the gastrojejunostomy and hepaticojejunostomy, with possible reflux of intestinal contents up the afferent limb, all partially managed by diet changes.\nIn 2017, a biannual screening MRI with intravenous contrast showed a new pancreatic lesion measuring 2.3 × 2.2 cm in the tail of the pancreas (). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy identified it as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. From 2011 to 2017, she had had close followup with serial CA 19-9, and a measurement of this marker after identification of the lesion on MRI showed an elevation, which was confirmed on repeat testing (61 and 55 U/mL; normal <37 U/mL). This was the first instance of two consecutive CA 19-9 measurements outside of the normal range since resection of the primary cancer 6 years prior. When the patient presented to our institution a few months later, the CA 19-9 had returned to normal at 32 U/mL (), and there was a moderate increase in CEA (16.9 ng/mL; normal <3 ng/mL). The patient received a second MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast to identify distant disease, which showed the lesion to be confined to the pancreas. Along with the MRI of the abdomen, a CT of the chest was preformed, which showed no gross metastatic lesions. A completion pancreatectomy was scheduled with revision and lengthening of the jejunal limb proximal to the gastrojejunostomy to resect the tumor and treat her episodes of early satiety and recurrent cholangitis.\nIntraoperatively, the patient's three Whipple anastomoses were noted to be grossly intact and there was no evidence of metastatic disease. First, the stomach was divided approximately two centimeters proximal to the prior gastrojejunostomy. The jejunostomy was closed, and gastrocolic and gastrosplenic ligaments were divided. The splenic artery was ligated, and the splenocolic ligament was divided. The spleen and pancreas were mobilized out of the retroperitoneum. The jejunum was divided between the pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) and hepaticojejunostomy. The proximal jejunum, prior PJ, remaining pancreas, and spleen were removed. The tumor was noted to be grossly confined to the pancreas. The distal end of the stomach was delivered through the mesocolon and a retrocolic gastrojejunostomy was undertaken 60 cm downstream from the hepaticojejunostomy. The anatomy before and after this operation is shown in .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and had an uncomplicated hospital course. The patient was closely followed postoperatively and did well. She completed two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine from January 2018 to April 2018, but did have some neutropenia at the end of her adjuvant therapy requiring pegfilgrastim. Her intermittent fevers, early satiety, and abdominal pain resolved after the surgery. She became an obligate insulin-dependent diabetic after the completion pancreatectomy procedure and now requires exogenous pancreatic enzymes to support her nutrient absorption.\nThe specimen was found to be consistent with a poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. Resection margins were negative, and 2 of 17 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic cancer. We sent representative slides of the patient's 2017 tumor and 2011 tumor to Perthera (McLean, VA) for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and histological analysis, which tested for mutations in a total of 315 genes and stained for various predictive biomarkers (). Both lesions showed the same mutations in KRAS (G12R), CDKN2A (splice site 151-1 G to A), and TP53 (Y220C). In addition, her 2011 tumor had a mutation in ACVR1B (S4) that was not present in the 2017 tumor, and the 2017 tumor had amplifications of MYC and mutant KRAS that were not present in the 2011 tumor (). Upon histological analysis, staining for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, pAKT, and HER2 was similar in both samples, but in the 2017 tumor, there was 60% increased staining for RRM1 and 20% increased staining for ERCC1, which changed the classification from low to high staining for ERCC1.

During the third trimester, he was found to have right hydronephrosis, with an anteroposterior diameter (APD) of 27 mm and SFU 4. His left kidney and urinary bladder were normal, as were his initial physical examination and laboratory workup at birth. A voiding cystourethrogram at 1 day of age showed a normal bladder and urethra and no evidence of vesicoureteric reflux. Ultrasound examination showed right hydronephrosis with an APD of 26 mm (). Diuretic renal scintigraphy with Tc 99m DTPA showed right renal pelvic dilatation with an obstructive pattern of radiotracer washout and a differential renal function of 40% (). Follow-up renal ultrasound at 2 months of age showed the persistence of high grade right hydronephrosis with mild thinning of the renal cortex.\nBased on a preoperative working diagnosis of right pelviureteric junction obstruction, the patient was scheduled for right pyeloplasty.

102139,"A man in his 60s presented to the emergency room with large, exophytic posterior neck mass continuous with a yellow-tan nodule in the subcutaneous tissue measuring a 5.7×5.0 cm that was bleeding (). The patient stated that this mass had grown significantly in size over a short period of time and would spontaneously bleed on his clothes and bedding. His medical history included metastatic RCC diagnosed four years ago for which he underwent a left nephrectomy and metastatic disease to the lumbar spine for which he also underwent surgical resection and radiation. A short course of chemotherapy was stopped because of poor response.\nOn examination, the neck mass was cauliflower-shaped, grey-tan in color, rubbery in consistency, with some bleeding originating from the necrotic center (). The necrotic core was bleeding and temporary hemostasis was achieved. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck demonstrated an exophytic, cutaneous neck mass without involvement deep to the posterior cervical fascia (). Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated primary feeders to be the bilateral occipital arteries (, ). Additionally, selective catheterization of the bilateral thyrocervical and costocervical trunks demonstrated prominent ascending and deep cervical vessels and tumor blush. Arterial feeder supply was also noted from the muscular branches of the right V1 segment of the vertebral artery (VA). There was no tumor involvement of the left VA.\nThe patient was counseled about these findings and given the extensive arterial supply, prior spontaneous hemorrhage, the surgical team requested preoperative embolization prior to resection. Direct puncture of the lesion was considered given the long distance and tortuosity of the primary occipital artery feeders. However, the unusually large diameter of the occipital artery feeders and safer hemostatic control associated with a femoral puncture influenced us to proceed with a femoral approach transarterial occipital artery embolization.\nThe left external carotid feeders were selectively catheterized using a Scepter (MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) microcatheter over a Synchro 14 microwire (Stryker, Freemont, CA, USA). Partial embolization was performed using a slow controlled injection of Onyx-18 (EV3, Irvine, CA, USA) (). The large occipital artery caliber, despite its tortuosity, allowed for uncomplicated use of the balloon microcatheter to immediately halt retrograde Onyx penetration and quickly achieve tumor penetration.

A man in his 60s presented to the emergency room with large, exophytic posterior neck mass continuous with a yellow-tan nodule in the subcutaneous tissue measuring a 5.7×5.0 cm that was bleeding (). The patient stated that this mass had grown significantly in size over a short period of time and would spontaneously bleed on his clothes and bedding. His medical history included metastatic RCC diagnosed four years ago for which he underwent a left nephrectomy and metastatic disease to the lumbar spine for which he also underwent surgical resection and radiation. A short course of chemotherapy was stopped because of poor response.\nOn examination, the neck mass was cauliflower-shaped, grey-tan in color, rubbery in consistency, with some bleeding originating from the necrotic center (). The necrotic core was bleeding and temporary hemostasis was achieved. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck demonstrated an exophytic, cutaneous neck mass without involvement deep to the posterior cervical fascia (). Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated primary feeders to be the bilateral occipital arteries (, ). Additionally, selective catheterization of the bilateral thyrocervical and costocervical trunks demonstrated prominent ascending and deep cervical vessels and tumor blush. Arterial feeder supply was also noted from the muscular branches of the right V1 segment of the vertebral artery (VA). There was no tumor involvement of the left VA.\nThe patient was counseled about these findings and given the extensive arterial supply, prior spontaneous hemorrhage, the surgical team requested preoperative embolization prior to resection. Direct puncture of the lesion was considered given the long distance and tortuosity of the primary occipital artery feeders. However, the unusually large diameter of the occipital artery feeders and safer hemostatic control associated with a femoral puncture influenced us to proceed with a femoral approach transarterial occipital artery embolization.\nThe left external carotid feeders were selectively catheterized using a Scepter (MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) microcatheter over a Synchro 14 microwire (Stryker, Freemont, CA, USA). Partial embolization was performed using a slow controlled injection of Onyx-18 (EV3, Irvine, CA, USA) (). The large occipital artery caliber, despite its tortuosity, allowed for uncomplicated use of the balloon microcatheter to immediately halt retrograde Onyx penetration and quickly achieve tumor penetration. This same embolization sequence was performed on the contralateral side. Partial occlusion of the right and left occipital arteries was achieved with 1.31 mL and 0.4 mL of Onyx-18, respectively. Selective catheterizations were performed of the thyrocervical and costocervical trunk but no embolization was performed given the extensive reduction of the tumor's vascular supply by the occipital feeders.\nThe patient had an uncomplicated immediate postoperative period and reported improvement in local symptoms. Surgical resection was then performed with less than 50 mL of blood loss. Microscopic examination was consistent with RCC and the gross specimen demonstrated large areas of necrosis and embolization material (). At one month follow up incision site was well healed and his quality of life after mass removal had improved. Due to the progression of his cancer and modest response to additional chemotherapy, he died 9 months after resection of this lesion.

42287,"A 34 year-old Korean woman was in her first trimester of pregnancy when she developed proteinuria. She was not edematous and did not have hypertension. Her proteinuria became increasingly severe and by her third trimester of pregnancy her urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPC) was greater than 10 gm/gm. She was induced at 37 weeks gestation and delivered a healthy boy who had no complications. Her proteinuria did not resolve following delivery and percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed. This demonstrated 1 out of 20 globally sclerotic glomeruli with no other abnormalities on light microscopy. Immunofluorescent staining was negative. Electron microscopy revealed moderate podocyte effacement and segmental basement membrane thinning. She has persistently declined treatment, including use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and all forms of immunomodulatory therapy. Despite this, her UPC has been stable for several years at 1.0 gm/gm and her creatinine has consistently measured less than 1.0 gm/dl.\nThere was suspicion of a genetic component to her disease as her mother had developed end-stage kidney disease in her mid-50s and her brother had proteinuria progressing to chronic kidney disease (Figure ). The mother presented with shrunken kidneys and had not been able to undergo biopsy; she underwent kidney transplantation at 55 years and has had no proteinuria since that time. The brother's clinical history has not been confirmed due to lack of consent. Per his sister's report, proteinuria was initially mild and he opted against kidney biopsy until his proteinuria worsened and he subsequently developed chronic renal insufficiency. His biopsy reportedly demonstrated minimal change disease and he was treated with oral steroids without any improvement.\nGenetic testing of TRPC6 was performed due to the apparent autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. She was found to be heterozygous for a novel TRPC6 frameshift mutation resulting from a 4 base pair GATA deletion in exon 12 [c. 2617–2620 del GATA, p. D873fsX878] (Figure ). The reported mutation is novel, as it has not been seen in over 90 patients with nephrotic syndrome sequenced in our laboratory, is not reported in any dbSNP or exome sequencing databases of normal controls, and has not been previously reported in TRPC6. The resultant frameshift leads to a premature stop codon, and is predicted to result in a truncated TRPC6 protein lacking the C-terminal coiled coil domain. The proband's mother also tested positive for the same mutation but her brother did not wish to be tested. DNA sequencing for mutations in ACTN4, INF2, and NPHS2 associated with adolescent or adult onset nephrotic syndrome revealed no other mutations in this family (data not shown). Due to segmental basement membrane thinning on the proband's kidney biopsy and the possibility of X-linked transmission in this family, the collagen 4 alpha 5 (COL4A5) gene was also sequenced in the proband's mother and was negative for mutations.","{'visit motivation': 'Proteinuria during pregnancy, persisting after delivery', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Proteinuria became increasingly severe during pregnancy', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '34', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'Korean', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'Mother developed end-stage kidney disease in her mid-50s and underwent kidney transplantation at 55 years with no proteinuria since.

1006,"A 52-year-old male patient presented with the complaint of sudden vision loss in his left eye 3 days earlier. Past medical history was significant for chronic kidney disease, secondary hypertension, chronic hepatitis C virus infection and arrhythmia. Ophthalmologic examination revealed best corrected visual acuity of 10/10 in the right eye and 4/10 in the left eye from the temporal field. Confrontation test revealed inferonasal visual field loss in the left eye. Direct and indirect light reflexes were normal in both eyes and there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Anterior segment examination was normal and intraocular pressure was 13 mmHg in both eyes. Dilated fundus exam demonstrated soft exudates consistent with hypertensive retinopathy in the right eye. Fundoscopy of the left eye revealed an area of pallor in the superotemporal quadrant and the macula with macular cherry red spot, which were consistent with occlusion of the superotemporal branch of the left retinal artery (). On OCT, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was within normal limits (). In the patient's visual field, there was an inferonasal defect in the left eye corresponding to the occluded region (). The patient was treated with a single dose of 500 cc intravenous dextran-40 and 200 mg intravenous pentoxifylline. In etiologic studies, Doppler ultrasonography revealed an atherosclerotic stenosis in the right and left main carotid arteries and a calcified plaque causing luminal narrowing in the left internal carotid artery. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed second- to third-degree aortic valve regurgitation and first-degree tricuspid valve regurgitation. There was no improvement in visual acuity or visual field despite treatment. At follow-up 7 months later, OCT showed thinning of the superior, inferior and temporal peripapillary RNFL (). On the thickness map, ganglion cell layer was thinner in the superior and temporal areas (). Decreased vascular density in the superficial and deep capillary plexus consistent with ischemia in the regions supplied by the superotemporal branch of the retinal artery was observed in a 6x6 mm macular field on OCTA (). The borders of the ischemic area were more clearly seen in en face images (). In optic disc OCTA, capillary density was reduced in the superotemporal region and collateral vessels were present in the area ().

48390,"A seven-year-old male in the United States without significant past medical history presented with three episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. These seizures occurred consecutively without regaining consciousness. A day prior, he fell off a trampoline where he sustained neck trauma followed by mild neck pain with associated nausea and vomiting. Since there was no loss of consciousness or any focal neurological trauma, the patient was not taken to the emergency department (ED) on initial trauma. On arrival at the ED the next day, he was noted with right gaze deviation and was unresponsive. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast did not reveal any acute pathology. Routine labs were within normal limits including complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, prothrombin time/international randomized ratio, salicylate, and acetaminophen; alcohol level was less than 0.01, and urine drug screen was negative. He was loaded with one gram of levetiracetam with a maintenance of 180 mg twice daily. For airway protection, he was intubated and was admitted to the pediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further care and management.\nSeizure workup included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain without contrast, which revealed areas of infarction in the left pons, midbrain, and cerebellar regions (Figure ). Due to these findings, computed tomography angiograms (CTA) of the head and neck were obtained revealing left vertebral artery dissection with associated complete occlusion of the left V3 segment of vertebral artery (VA) and distal basilar artery thrombosis (Figure ). The stroke intervention team was notified of these findings, and the patient was taken for a successful emergent mechanical thrombectomy with Sophia 6 French catheter (Figure ) after a repeat rapid brain imaging protocol consisting of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequence did not reveal the expansion of ischemic changes compared to prior MRI. At the end of the procedure, a successful thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 (TICI3) recanalization was achieved. Of note, the mechanical thrombectomy was performed 6.5 hours after the time of presentation to the ED.\nPrior to performing mechanical thrombectomy, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 21. However, the patient was intubated and sedated. General neurological exam revealed the following: intact brainstem reflexes, dysconjugate gaze, withdrawal to noxious stimuli in the right side, and extensor response with noxious stimuli in the left side.\nHe was successfully extubated several hours after undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. Post extubation and mechanical thrombectomy neurological exam showed ability to follow commands, complete resolution of dysarthria within three days, persistent bilateral ptosis, 4 mm reactive pupils bilaterally, persistent dysconjugate gaze secondary to left sixth nerve palsy, and intact movement of all extremities except for left upper extremity ataxia. On the four-month follow-up visit, the patient had good neurological recovery with NIHSS of 1 for left upper extremity ataxia. He was discharged on levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis for a period of six months and was slowly weaned off. Additionally, he was discharged on aspirin, which was also discontinued at six months.","{'visit motivation': 'Three episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Generalized tonic-clonic seizures and subsequent findings of left vertebral artery dissection and distal basilar artery thrombosis', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU)'}], 'patient information': {'age': 'Seven-year-old', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'Not mentioned', 'weight': 'Not mentioned', 'height': 'Not mentioned', 'family medical history': 'Not mentioned', 'recent travels': 'Not mentioned', 'socio economic context': 'Not mentioned', 'occupation': 'Not mentioned'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'No significant past medical history', 'psychological context': 'Not mentioned', 'vaccination history': 'Not mentioned', 'allergies': 'Not mentioned', 'exercise frequency': 'Not mentioned', 'nutrition': 'Not mentioned', 'sexual history': 'Not mentioned', 'alcohol consumption': 'Not mentioned', 'drug usage': 'Not mentioned', 'smoking status': 'Not mentioned'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Distal basilar artery thrombosis', 'Type': 'Emergent mechanical thrombectomy', 'time': 'Not mentioned', 'outcome': 'Successful thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 (TICI 3) revascularization', 'details': 'Performed with Sophia 6 French catheter'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Generalized tonic-clonic seizures', 'intensity of symptom': 'Not mentioned', 'location': 'Not mentioned', 'time': 'Consecutively without regaining consciousness', 'temporalisation': 'Not mentioned', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Not mentioned', 'details': 'Occurred after neck trauma from falling off a trampoline'}, {'name of symptom': 'Neck pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'Mild', 'location': 'Neck', 'time': 'After falling off a trampoline', 'temporalisation': 'Not mentioned', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Not mentioned', 'details': 'Associated with nausea and vomiting'}, {'name of symptom': 'Right gaze deviation', 'intensity of symptom': 'Not mentioned', 'location': 'Eyes', 'time': 'On arrival at the ED', 'temporalisation': 'Not mentioned', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Not mentioned', 'details': 'Patient was unresponsive'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast', 'result': 'No acute pathology', 'details': 'Not mentioned'}, {'name': 'Routine labs', 'result': 'Within normal limits', 'details': 'Including complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, prothrombin time/international randomized ratio, salicylate, and acetaminophen levels; alcohol level was less than 0.01, and urine drug screen was negative'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain without contrast', 'severity': 'Not mentioned', 'result': 'Areas of infarction in the left pons, midbrain, and cerebellar regions', 'condition': 'Infarction', 'time': 'Not mentioned', 'details': 'Figure not included'}, {'test': 'Computed tomography angiograms (CTA) of the head and neck', 'severity': 'Not mentioned', 'result': 'Left vertebral artery dissection with associated complete occlusion of the left V3 segment of vertebral artery (VA) and distal basilar artery thrombosis', 'condition': 'Left vertebral artery dissection and distal basilar artery thrombosis', 'time': 'Not mentioned', 'details': 'Figure not included'}, {'test': 'Repeat rapid brain imaging protocol', 'severity': 'Not mentioned', 'result': 'No expansion of ischemic changes compared to prior MRI', 'condition': 'Assessment of ischemic changes', 'time': 'Before emergent mechanical thrombectomy', 'details': 'Consisting of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequence'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Levetiracetam', 'related condition': 'Seizures', 'dosage': 'One gram loaded, 180 mg', 'time': 'Not mentioned', 'frequency': 'Twice daily', 'duration': 'Not mentioned', 'reason for taking': 'To manage seizures', 'reaction to treatment': 'Not mentioned', 'details': 'Patient was intubated for airway protection'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'Not mentioned', 'referral': 'Not mentioned', 'follow up': 'Not mentioned', 'discharge summary': 'Not mentioned'}}","[['Are there any specific details mentioned about the surgical procedure or complications?', 'What was the reason for the surgery?', 'When was the surgery performed?', 'What was the outcome of the surgery (e.g., successful, complications)?', 'What type of surgery was performed?'], [""What are the patient's main symptoms or concerns upon admission?"", 'Does the note mention any significant family history of medical conditions?', ""What is the patient's ethnicity?

28365,"The patient was a 58-year-old woman with no history of psychiatric disorder before the age of 58. When she was younger (approximately 10 years old), despite tending to exhibit inattentiveness and forgetfulness, she obtained good grades in school, and these tendencies did not interfere with her daily life. Although her family noticed certain behaviors—such as inattentiveness and forgetfulness, which was manifested as hitting or misplacing things—they assumed that these tendencies were inherited, since other family members who exhibited similar issues were not diagnosed with psychiatric disease and did not require medical treatment. After graduating from high school, she worked at a bank. Although she was aware of a tendency to forget to take notes or misplace her documents at work, she never made any errors that caused serious repercussions and did not experience problems with her colleagues. After she retired from the bank at 52 years of age, she started her own business.\nAfter starting her own business, she was much busier than she had been when she was simply an employee. Within a year, her attentional difficulties and memory issues gradually progressed, and at approximately 57 years of age, she became so inattentive and forgetful that it interfered with her work and family life at home. For example, she forgot meetings with important clients, transferred money to the wrong bank account, and these failures resulted in poor management of her company. At home, she experienced increasing difficulties with remembering prior commitments with her family and misplacing items, which her family members noticed. With the encouragement of her family and employees, who worried that she was suffering from dementia, she visited our memory clinic at 58 years of age.\nUpon visiting the clinic, she reported that she perceived her increased forgetfulness was problematic since it was bothering the people around her; therefore, she feared having dementia and prepared herself to retire from her own company. She did not report experiencing reductions in her levels of desires or interests, and no depressive symptoms were noted during the medical interview. No neurological abnormalities, such as parkinsonism or pathological reflexes, were identified. Neuropsychological testing, such as Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, indicated that her memory was intact. Laboratory tests, including blood counts (e.g., full blood count, electrolytes, urea and creatinine, vitamins B1 and B12, and folic acid), blood biochemistry, and electroencephalography, did not reveal any abnormalities (Table ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain did not reveal any clear cerebral parenchymal atrophy in the hippocampus or other regions, but single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) indicated mildly decreased blood flow in the posterior cingulate cortex. Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) did not show amyloid deposition in the cerebral cortex, and the phosphorylated tau/amyloid beta-42 ratio in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was within the normal range (Fig. ).\nGiven that her condition at work and at home fulfilled eight of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for inattentiveness and three for hyperactivity/impulsivity, we diagnosed her with ADHD, and treatment with 18 mg of methylphenidate was initiated and continued this dose. Within a few days after starting the methylphenidate administration, pronounced improvements in her symptoms were observed; for example, she stopped losing her things, was able to concentrate for long durations, and could complete more tasks than she could prior to treatment, which surprised her family and subordinates. Thus, she no longer met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD (Table ). Although she thought she would have to retire from her business, she instead was able to return to work without issue. We conducted a follow up for 6 months with administration of 18 mg methylphenidate; during this period, her initial symptoms did not reappear.","{'visit motivation': 'Worried about increased forgetfulness and its impact on work and family life; fears of having dementia', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Concerns of dementia due to significant forgetfulness and attentional difficulties', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Memory clinic'}], 'patient information': {'age': '58 years old', 'sex': 'Woman', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'Other family members exhibited similar issues of inattentiveness and forgetfulness but were not diagnosed with psychiatric disease and did not require medical treatment.', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'Bank employee until age 52, then started her own business'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'None', 'psychological context': 'No history of psychiatric disorder before the age of 58', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Inattentiveness and forgetfulness', 'intensity of symptom': 'Progressed to a point where it interfered with work and family life', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'Gradually progressed within a year after starting her own business; became significantly problematic at approximately 57 years of age', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Becoming busier with her own business', 'details': 'Forgot meetings with important clients, transferred money to the wrong bank account, poor management of her company, difficulties with remembering prior commitments with family, and misplacing items'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'None', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?'], ['How does the symptom change over time (e.g., constant, intermittent, worsening)?', 'Where is the symptom located (e.g., body part)?', 'Are there any behaviors that affect the symptom (e.g., activities that worsen it)?', 'What specific symptom(s) did the patient report?', 'When did the symptom(s) start?', 'What is the intensity of the symptom (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)?']]",Medical Examinations,Symptoms,"

The patient was a 58-year-old woman with no history of psychiatric disorder before the age of 58. When she was younger (approximately 10 years old), despite tending to exhibit inattentiveness and forgetfulness, she obtained good grades in school, and these tendencies did not interfere with her daily life. Although her family noticed certain behaviors—such as inattentiveness and forgetfulness, which was manifested as hitting or misplacing things—they assumed that these tendencies were inherited, since other family members who exhibited similar issues were not diagnosed with psychiatric disease and did not require medical treatment. After graduating from high school, she worked at a bank. Although she was aware of a tendency to forget to take notes or misplace her documents at work, she never made any errors that caused serious repercussions and did not experience problems with her colleagues. After she retired from the bank at 52 years of age, she started her own business.\nAfter starting her own business, she was much busier than she had been when she was simply an employee. Within a year, her attentional difficulties and memory issues gradually progressed, and at approximately 57 years of age, she became so inattentive and forgetful that it interfered with her work and family life at home. For example, she forgot meetings with important clients, transferred money to the wrong bank account, and these failures resulted in poor management of her company. At home, she experienced increasing difficulties with remembering prior commitments with her family and misplacing items, which her family members noticed. With the encouragement of her family and employees, who worried that she was suffering from dementia, she visited our memory clinic at 58 years of age.\nUpon visiting the clinic, she reported that she perceived her increased forgetfulness was problematic since it was bothering the people around her; therefore, she feared having dementia and prepared herself to retire from her own company.

46347,"The patient is a 68-year-old lady with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism who presented with complaints of lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bright red blood per rectum. She was a retired medical assistant who had quit smoking 3-4 weeks prior to presentation after having smoked half pack a day for 30 years. Her home medications included lisinopril, simvastatin, aspirin, levothyroxine, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Her review of systems was positive for mild intermittent dry cough for the past 1.5 months. She denied fever, chills, weight loss, productive cough, hemoptysis, night sweats, and changes in urinary habits. She had unlimited exercise tolerance. Her physical examination in the emergency department was unremarkable except for mild tenderness to palpation over the lower abdomen. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed sigmoid and distal ascending colon colitis and incidentally identified a right hilar mass. The mass was in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and extended throughout the lower lobe along the pulmonary vessels (). The central part of the mass was enhancing with hypodensity noted peripherally suggestive of necrosis. The dominant portion of the mass measured up to 6 cm transverse × 3.4 cm antero-posterior. The tracheobronchial tree was found to be patent. An additional irregular, pleural based mass in the superior segment of the right lower lobe was also identified which measured 3.9 cm transverse × 1.5 cm anteroposterior. An additional pleural nodularity was noted in the inferior portion of the right lower lobe. These findings were highly suggestive of a right lower lobe malignancy. There was no significant mediastinal, axillary, or hilar adenopathy noted except for a subcarinal (9 mm in short axis) and paratracheal lymph node (5 mm in short axis). She underwent bronchoscopy which showed a friable exophytic endobronchial mass in the right lower lobe at 1 cm from the bronchus intermedius, rest of the anatomy normal. Bronchial brushings and endobronchial biopsies × 3 were done. Immunostaining was positive for mucicarmine, cytokeratin 7 (CK7), p63, focally positive for cytokeratins 5,6 (CK 5,6), negative for synaptophysin, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and Napsin A (hematoxylin and eosin stains are shown in Figures , , and ; immunostaining in Figures , , , and ). Positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) showed a large focus of intense uptake in the lower right lung medially, corresponding to a hilar mass extending to the lower lobe seen on chest CT. No other focal abnormalities are noted. She underwent right sided Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) with right middle and lower lobe bilobectomy with lymph node dissection. Pathology showed 2 separate synchronous carcinomas (1st tumor: nonsmall cell carcinoma, favor mucoepidermoid; 2nd tumor: mucinous adenocarcinoma). It was deemed that the patient had 2 distinct primaries, both staged at T2N1. Patient refused chemotherapy and has been doing well after procedure.","{'visit motivation': 'Lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bright red blood per rectum', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '68', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'Retired medical assistant'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'Unlimited exercise tolerance', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'Quit smoking 3-4 weeks prior to presentation after having smoked half pack a day for 30 years'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Lower abdominal pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'Mild', 'location': 'Lower abdomen', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Tenderness to palpation over the lower abdomen'}, {'name of symptom': 'Diarrhea', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name of symptom': 'Bright red blood per rectum', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name of symptom': 'Dry cough', 'intensity of symptom': 'Mild', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'Intermittent for the past 1.5 months', 'temporalisation': 'Intermittent', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Unremarkable except for mild tenderness to palpation over the lower abdomen', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'CT scan of the abdomen', 'severity': 'Highly suggestive of a right lower lobe malignancy', 'result': 'Sigmoid and distal ascending colon colitis, right hilar mass, pleural based mass, pleural nodularity', 'condition': 'Right lower lobe malignancy, colitis', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'The mass was in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and extended throughout the lower lobe along the pulmonary vessels.

31357,"A 48 years old, previously healthy male presented to the outpatient Infectious Disease clinic with an unintentional fifty pounds weight loss, extreme fatigue, drenching night sweats, and progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion for four months. There was no history of fever, cough, drug abuse, unusual exposures or dental procedures. Physical examination revealed normal vitals but a grade 4/6 systolic murmur in the mitral area. Rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations done by his primary care doctor a month prior to this presentation showed normocytic normochromic anemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 46 mm/ hr. Complete metabolic panel, thyroid function test, HIV screen and QuantiFERON were normal. Recent computed tomography of chest, abdomen, and pelvis without contrast showed moderate splenomegaly and few areas of diminished attenuation in the spleen representing old infarcts. Blood cultures were obtained and within 48 h grew gram-positive cocci, identified as Gemella morbilliform. Patient was admitted and started on intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Repeat blood cultures 48 h after initiation of antibiotics were negative. Echocardiogram revealed two mitral valve vegetations, 23 × 23 mm and 13 × 8 mm in size, with severe mitral regurgitation requiring mitral valve replacement. Patient was also found to have acute kidney injury secondary to endocarditis associated immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis. To further investigate the source of bacteremia, he underwent colonoscopy which was normal.\nThe isolate was submitted to a reference laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) but was unable to be performed using CLSI approved method due to poor growth of the organism. We also tried to perform AST in our research laboratory using broth microdilution testing but was unsuccessful as the organism did not grow in the wells when using Mueller Hinton Broth with 5% lysed horse blood []. We were able to determine AST results for the Gemella sample using Etest© strips. The E-test Application Guide [] procedure for ""Fastidious Gram-Positive Organisms"" was utilized. The inoculum was prepared from a 24 h growth and made equivalent to a 1.0 McFarland standard in Brain Heart Infusion Broth. The plates were incubated at 35℃ in 5% CO2.The media recommended by E-test and CLSI was Mueller Hinton agar with 5% blood, but when using this media, we were unable to get sufficient growth to read the results. We were able to get sufficient growth using Tryptone Soya agar with 5% sheep blood, but the organism grew the best on Brucella agar with 5% sheep blood, hemin and vitamin K []. With the Brucella agar the growth was confluent and allowed us to easily read the eclipse for the E-test. The E-test application guide recommends Brucella agar for anaerobes. The organism required 48 h of growth to correctly read the results. SPNE ATCC 49,619 was used for quality control as recommended by CLSI. The results are shown in the table.\nIntravenous vancomycin was discontinued after the results of the AST, and treatment was continued with intravenous ceftriaxone alone.

A 48 years old, previously healthy male presented to the outpatient Infectious Disease clinic with an unintentional fifty pounds weight loss, extreme fatigue, drenching night sweats, and progressively worsening shortness of breath with exertion for four months. There was no history of fever, cough, drug abuse, unusual exposures or dental procedures. Physical examination revealed normal vitals but a grade 4/6 systolic murmur in the mitral area. Rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations done by his primary care doctor a month prior to this presentation showed normocytic normochromic anemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 46 mm/ hr. Complete metabolic panel, thyroid function test, HIV screen and QuantiFERON were normal. Recent computed tomography of chest, abdomen, and pelvis without contrast showed moderate splenomegaly and few areas of diminished attenuation in the spleen representing old infarcts. Blood cultures were obtained and within 48 h grew gram-positive cocci, identified as Gemella morbilliform. Patient was admitted and started on intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Repeat blood cultures 48 h after initiation of antibiotics were negative. Echocardiogram revealed two mitral valve vegetations, 23 × 23 mm and 13 × 8 mm in size, with severe mitral regurgitation requiring mitral valve replacement. Patient was also found to have acute kidney injury secondary to endocarditis associated immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis. To further investigate the source of bacteremia, he underwent colonoscopy which was normal.\nThe isolate was submitted to a reference laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) but was unable to be performed using CLSI approved method due to poor growth of the organism. We also tried to perform AST in our research laboratory using broth microdilution testing but was unsuccessful as the organism did not grow in the wells when using Mueller Hinton Broth with 5% lysed horse blood []. We were able to determine AST results for the Gemella sample using Etest© strips. The E-test Application Guide [] procedure for ""Fastidious Gram-Positive Organisms"" was utilized. The inoculum was prepared from a 24 h growth and made equivalent to a 1.0 McFarland standard in Brain Heart Infusion Broth. The plates were incubated at 35℃ in 5% CO2.The media recommended by E-test and CLSI was Mueller Hinton agar with 5% blood, but when using this media, we were unable to get sufficient growth to read the results. We were able to get sufficient growth using Tryptone Soya agar with 5% sheep blood, but the organism grew the best on Brucella agar with 5% sheep blood, hemin and vitamin K []. With the Brucella agar the growth was confluent and allowed us to easily read the eclipse for the E-test. The E-test application guide recommends Brucella agar for anaerobes. The organism required 48 h of growth to correctly read the results. SPNE ATCC 49,619 was used for quality control as recommended by CLSI. The results are shown in the table.\nIntravenous vancomycin was discontinued after the results of the AST, and treatment was continued with intravenous ceftriaxone alone. Patient finished 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone post mitral valve replacement. Renal function gradually improved, and creatinine returned to baseline by the end of treatment. Repeat blood cultures done two weeks post antibiotic therapy were negative. On follow-up visits patient reported significant improvement in his weight, fatigue, night sweats and activity level.

93855,"A 13-year-old boy was presented with a Class I skeletal base and a Class I incisor relationship with increased mandibular plane angle and increased lower facial heights. Extraoral examination demonstrated facial symmetry and a straight profile. The upper left central and lateral incisors were in crossbite. The upper dental centreline was deviated 1.0 mm to the left of the mid-facial axis. The lips were competent at rest. There was 3.0 mm of incisor show on smiling.\nIntra-oral examination revealed fair oral hygiene. There were no active carious lesions. In the maxillary arch, there was a bony defect mesial to the upper left central incisor. A space of 5.5 mm existed in the alveolar ridge where the upper left canine was extracted. The upper left central incisor was buccally displaced and the lateral incisor was palatally displaced. There was anterior mandibular displacement of 2 mm upon closure. The left central and lateral incisors were in crossbite and were retroclined relative to the maxillary plane (Figure ).\nIn the mandibular arch the labial segment was mildly crowded and retroclined relative to the mandibular plane. There was a curve of Spee measuring 2 mm at its deepest part (Figure ).\nIn centric occlusion, the incisor relationship was Class I with overjet of 4 mm at the right central incisors, and with a reverse overjet of 0.5 mm and a reduced and incomplete overbite. The molar relationship was Class I. There was a decreased buccal overjet at the posterior segments.\nRadiographic examination confirmed the absence of the upper right canine and the presence of unerupted third molars and no carious lesions were detected. The upper left central incisor showed short root, and the lower incisors showed pipette shaped roots (Figure ).\nThe cephalometric analysis showed a skeletal Class I base (ANB and Wit's appraisal) with slightly retrognathic maxilla. The upper and lower facial heights were increased. There was an increased mandibular plane angle which was in agreement with increased lower facial height, but in good proportion with the upper facial height. The lower incisors were retroclined, and were on the Point A- Po line (Figure )\nThe aims of the treatment were: 1. To close upper anterior space by mesialization of 21, 2. To eliminate anterior crossbite by proclination of displaced upper anterior teeth, 3. To relieve lower crowding and flatten curve of Spee.\nThe treatment plan was orthodontic treatment with fixed pre-adjusted appliance without extraction in the upper arch; and extraction of 34 in the lower arch. The abnormal positioning of 21 and 22 posed the main problem, and was exaggerated by the bony defect. Proper biomechanics were needed to mesialize the displaced tooth 21 into the anterior space to repair the bony defect.","{'visit motivation': 'Class I skeletal base and Class I incisor relationship with dental issues', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '13', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'Student'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'None', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Extraction of upper left canine', 'Type': 'Tooth extraction', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'A space of 5.5 mm existed in the alveolar ridge where the upper left canine was extracted'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Increased mandibular plane angle and increased lower facial heights', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Mandibular region', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Extraoral examination demonstrated facial symmetry and a straight profile'}, {'name of symptom': 'Crossbite of upper left central and lateral incisors', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Upper left central and lateral incisors', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'The upper dental centreline was deviated 1.0 mm to the left of the mid-facial axis'}, {'name of symptom': 'Anterior mandibular displacement', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Mandibular region', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Anterior mandibular displacement of 2 mm upon closure'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Extraoral examination', 'result': 'Facial symmetry, straight profile, competent lips at rest, 3.0 mm of incisor show on smiling', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Intra-oral examination', 'result': 'Fair oral hygiene, no active carious lesions, bony defect mesial to the upper left central incisor, buccally displaced upper left central incisor, palatally displaced lateral incisor, mildly crowded and retroclined mandibular arch labial segment, curve of Spee', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Radiographic examination', 'result': 'Absence of the upper right canine, presence of unerupted third molars, no carious lesions, short root of the upper left central incisor, pipette shaped roots of the lower incisors', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Cephalometric analysis', 'result': 'Skeletal Class I base with slightly retrognathic maxilla', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'None', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What is the intensity of the symptom (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)?', 'Are there any behaviors that affect the symptom (e.g., activities that worsen it)?', 'How does the symptom change over time (e.g., constant, intermittent, worsening)?', 'Where is the symptom located (e.g., body part)?', 'When did the symptom(s) start?', 'What specific symptom(s) did the patient report?'], ['When was the surgery performed?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the surgical procedure or complications?', 'What was the outcome of the surgery (e.g., successful, complications)?', 'What was the reason for the surgery?', 'What type of surgery was performed?']]",Symptoms,Surgeries,"

17939,"A 63-year-old male with progressive dysphagia for 15 days was found to have thickened walls in the mid-esophageal region and tumor thrombus formation in the arch of the azygos vein (Fig. a, S) according to contrast-enhanced CT; this was accompanied by mediastinal lymphadenectasis. Gastroscopy confirmed the presence of a neoplasm in the esophageal lumen located 28–35 cm away from the incisor. Biopsy suggested poorly differentiated carcinoma of the esophagus, and immunohistochemistry showed a tendency for basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. b). The patient had smoked for 44 years, with 20 cigarettes per day, but had quit smoking for 1 month; the patient had no history of alcohol consumption and denied any history of cardiovascular disease, and no abnormalities were found on the cardiac ultrasound. The patient then received four rounds of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which consisted of 400 mg Abraxane, 120 mg nedaplatin via intravenous drip on d1, Q3W. Twenty-five days after the last round of chemotherapy, enhanced CT of the chest suggested a significant reduction in the tumor volume, mediastinal lymph nodes, and tumor thrombus in the arch of the azygos vein (Fig. c, S), and general PET-CT showed no distant metastasis.\nOne month later, the patient underwent McKeown radical resection. Intraoperative exploration showed a tumor located at the level of the arch of the azygos vein, measuring approximately 3 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter, with the tumor invading into the esophageal outer membrane. Two enlarged lymph nodes measuring approximately 1 cm in maximum diameter were present around the tumor, and the tumor had a relatively clear boundary with the surrounding tissues. The arch of the azygos vein was hard in nature, wherein the embolus could be palpated (Fig. a, b and c). The operative process included entering the posterior-lateral 5th intercostal space of the right chest to expose the esophageal bed and open the mediastinal pleura; the superior vena cava at the arch of the azygos vein was first dissociated, and sidewall forceps were used to clip the converging point of the superior vena cava and azygos vein. This, in turn, prevented tumor thrombus detachment, and then the normal azygous vein was dissociated at the T6 level and blocked. Branches of the intercostal veins were dissociated seriatim and underwent ligation to prevent tumor thrombus detachment countercurrently. Scissors were then used to open the azygos vein, and further exploration showed a clear boundary between the tumor thrombus and the vascular wall of the arch of the azygos vein. There was no invasion or adhesion between the thrombus and the vasculature. After that, blunt and complete dissection of the embolus at the arch of the azygos vein was performed, and the embolus was approximately 1 cm in diameter and 3 cm in length, with no residual embolus observed. Heparin water was used for washing to detach the azygos vein, and then a 5–0 Prolene propene line was used for suturing the azygous vein. We tried to maintain the integrity of the azygos vein during surgery to maintain venous return and to stabilize the gastric tube because of the relative position in the chest. The total length of the esophagus was dissociated. A median incision in the upper abdomen was performed to make a gastric tube, and esophagogastric anastomosis was completed through a right neck incision.\nPostoperatively, enteral combined with intravenous nutritional therapy was given. The patient received a clear and liquid diet on day 8 after surgery and was discharged without any severe complications. Postoperative pathology revealed the proliferation of fibrous tissue at the submucosal and muscular layers of the esophageal tumor bed, and a multinucleated giant cell reaction was partially observed, accompanied by infiltration of a small number of lymphocytes and plasmocytes (Fig. a). There was no evidence of residual cancer tissue, and complete remission was achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. No metastasis was observed at the mediastinal, celiac, or cervical lymph nodes.

A 63-year-old male with progressive dysphagia for 15 days was found to have thickened walls in the mid-esophageal region and tumor thrombus formation in the arch of the azygos vein (Fig. a, S) according to contrast-enhanced CT; this was accompanied by mediastinal lymphadenectasis. Gastroscopy confirmed the presence of a neoplasm in the esophageal lumen located 28–35 cm away from the incisor. Biopsy suggested poorly differentiated carcinoma of the esophagus, and immunohistochemistry showed a tendency for basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. b). The patient had smoked for 44 years, with 20 cigarettes per day, but had quit smoking for 1 month; the patient had no history of alcohol consumption and denied any history of cardiovascular disease, and no abnormalities were found on the cardiac ultrasound. The patient then received four rounds of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which consisted of 400 mg Abraxane, 120 mg nedaplatin via intravenous drip on d1, Q3W. Twenty-five days after the last round of chemotherapy, enhanced CT of the chest suggested a significant reduction in the tumor volume, mediastinal lymph nodes, and tumor thrombus in the arch of the azygos vein (Fig. c, S), and general PET-CT showed no distant metastasis.\nOne month later, the patient underwent McKeown radical resection. Intraoperative exploration showed a tumor located at the level of the arch of the azygos vein, measuring approximately 3 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter, with the tumor invading into the esophageal outer membrane. Two enlarged lymph nodes measuring approximately 1 cm in maximum diameter were present around the tumor, and the tumor had a relatively clear boundary with the surrounding tissues. The arch of the azygos vein was hard in nature, wherein the embolus could be palpated (Fig. a, b and c). The operative process included entering the posterior-lateral 5th intercostal space of the right chest to expose the esophageal bed and open the mediastinal pleura; the superior vena cava at the arch of the azygos vein was first dissociated, and sidewall forceps were used to clip the converging point of the superior vena cava and azygos vein. This, in turn, prevented tumor thrombus detachment, and then the normal azygous vein was dissociated at the T6 level and blocked. Branches of the intercostal veins were dissociated seriatim and underwent ligation to prevent tumor thrombus detachment countercurrently. Scissors were then used to open the azygos vein, and further exploration showed a clear boundary between the tumor thrombus and the vascular wall of the arch of the azygos vein. There was no invasion or adhesion between the thrombus and the vasculature. After that, blunt and complete dissection of the embolus at the arch of the azygos vein was performed, and the embolus was approximately 1 cm in diameter and 3 cm in length, with no residual embolus observed. Heparin water was used for washing to detach the azygos vein, and then a 5–0 Prolene propene line was used for suturing the azygous vein. We tried to maintain the integrity of the azygos vein during surgery to maintain venous return and to stabilize the gastric tube because of the relative position in the chest. The total length of the esophagus was dissociated. A median incision in the upper abdomen was performed to make a gastric tube, and esophagogastric anastomosis was completed through a right neck incision.\nPostoperatively, enteral combined with intravenous nutritional therapy was given. The patient received a clear and liquid diet on day 8 after surgery and was discharged without any severe complications. Postoperative pathology revealed the proliferation of fibrous tissue at the submucosal and muscular layers of the esophageal tumor bed, and a multinucleated giant cell reaction was partially observed, accompanied by infiltration of a small number of lymphocytes and plasmocytes (Fig. a). There was no evidence of residual cancer tissue, and complete remission was achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. No metastasis was observed at the mediastinal, celiac, or cervical lymph nodes. Most of the emboli in the azygos vein were necrotic tissues, wherein small focal cancer tissues measuring 3 mm in maximum diameter were present (Fig. b).

62079,"A 16-year-old male runner fell forward over an outstretched left leg during a race. He felt a popping sensation with his left hip in deep flexion and the left knee in forced extension and a sharp pain in the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh. He could not bear weight on the affected leg, which prevented him from walking and he was immediately transferred to our hospital. He had no history of other trauma, chronic disease, or use of corticosteroids. A clinical examination revealed swelling and tenderness at the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh. The ridge formed by the left biceps femoris tendon was distinctly deficient to both visual inspection and palpation. Active extension or flexion of the left knee was prevented by severe pain. Ligamentous instability of the knee was not evident and the left knee appeared normal on plain radiography images. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the left thigh revealed a loss of continuity of the distal biceps femoris tendon at the musculotendinous junction surrounded by a hematoma with high signal intensity (). Isolated rupture of the distal part of the left biceps femoris tendon was diagnosed and surgical exploration proceeded under lumbar spinal anaesthesia. A lateral incision over the belly of the biceps femoris revealed that the biceps femoris tendon had completely ruptured at the musculotendinous junction (). The tear was repaired using a modified Kessler method with strong nonabsorbable sutures.\nThe knee was postoperatively immobilized in a plaster cast at 30° of flexion. However, the patient described numbness and sensory loss over the anterior aspect of the left foot and dorsiflexion of the foot was weak on the day after surgery. Common peroneal nerve palsy at the fibular head due to compression by the plaster cast was diagnosed and the cast was removed to decompress the nerve. However, this did not result in any neurological improvement. Surgical assessment was applied 2 months after the common peroneal palsy occurred. Reexploration findings showed complete repair of the ruptured tendon, but the common peroneal and sural nerves were entrapped by the surgical suture, which had also penetrated the common peroneal nerve. Both nerves were obviously constricted after removal of the surgical suture (). Both nerves were externally neurolysed and scar tissue was removed. Motor function completely recovered 15 months later, but some residual numbness in the lower left leg persisted.","{'visit motivation': 'Injury during a race', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Inability to bear weight on the affected leg and immediate transfer after injury', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '16', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'Runner'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'No history of other trauma, chronic disease, or use of corticosteroids', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'Regular (as indicated by being a runner)', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Isolated rupture of the distal part of the left biceps femoris tendon', 'Type': 'Surgical exploration and repair of the ruptured tendon', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Complete repair of the ruptured tendon but subsequent common peroneal nerve palsy', 'details': 'Surgery proceeded under lumbar spinal anaesthesia; modified Kessler method with strong nonabsorbable sutures was used for repair'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Popping sensation, sharp pain, inability to bear weight, swelling, tenderness, numbness, sensory loss, weak dorsiflexion', 'intensity of symptom': 'Severe', 'location': 'Left hip, posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh, anterior aspect of the left foot', 'time': 'During a race', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Deep flexion of the hip and forced extension of the knee during the fall', 'details': 'Active extension or flexion of the left knee was prevented by severe pain'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Clinical examination', 'result': 'Swelling and tenderness at the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh, distinctly deficient ridge formed by the left biceps femoris tendon', 'details': 'Ligamentous instability of the knee was not evident; normal left knee on plain radiography'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'T2-weighted magnetic resonance images', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Loss of continuity of the distal biceps femoris tendon at the musculotendinous junction surrounded by a hematoma with high signal intensity', 'condition': 'Isolated rupture of the distal part of the left biceps femoris tendon', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Surgical repair, immobilization in a plaster cast, removal of the cast', 'related condition': 'Ruptured biceps femoris tendon, common peroneal nerve palsy', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Postoperatively; the day after surgery; 2 months after the common peroneal palsy occurred', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To repair the tendon rupture and to decompress the nerve', 'reaction to treatment': 'Numbness and sensory loss over the anterior aspect of the left foot and weak dorsiflexion of the foot; no neurological improvement after cast removal', 'details': 'Knee was immobilized in a plaster cast at 30° of flexion; cast was removed due to common peroneal nerve palsy'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[[""What is the motivation for the patient's visit?""], ['Does the patient have any allergies to medications or other substances?', ""Does the note mention the patient's alcohol consumption habits (e.g., frequency, amount)?"", ""Does the note mention the patient's smoking history?

20685,"A 1-year-old boy was referred for evaluation by the neurosurgery team with an expansile nodular lesion in the right retroauricular region. The mother stated that a retroauricular bulging has been present in this region since his birth; however, the professionals who were consulted at the time believed there was no clinical significance. The neuropsychomotor development (NPMD) of the child was normal for his age and he had no previous significant history of pathology. His maternal uncle was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia at the age of 9. Germline genetic testings were not performed.\nThe initial skull radiography showed bone sclerosis associated with probable intracranial calcification in the right retroauricular region at the parieto-occipital transition. The ultrasound highlighted a homogeneous and regular hypoechoic nodule, with 32 × 26 × 12 mm, located below the subcutaneous tissue in close contact with the adjacent bone cortex. The colour Doppler imaging identified peripheral vessels adjacent to the main lesion. Computerised tomography revealed a 4.2 × 4.5 × 3.6 cm of a neoplastic lesion with an epicentre on the skullcap of the right temporo-occipital transition with intracranial and extracranial expansion; the lesion was compressing the adjacent cephalic structures apparently in a supratentorial compartment (). Brain magnetic resonance displayed an intracranial component in the posterior cranial fossa, compressing the adjacent cerebellar hemisphere. In the middle cranial fossa, the component was rectifying the turns of the posterior aspect of the anterior temporal pole on this side (). Among the diagnostic hypotheses were the fibrosarcoma, the meningioma, and the eosinophilic granuloma.\nThe patient underwent surgery and intraoperative frozen section. The histopathology of the tissue revealed a biphasic tumour tangential to the resection margins, characterised by small, round and blue cells, as well as pseudoglandular arrangement with pigmented cells infiltrating the bone and muscle tissue (). We initially concluded that it was a MNTI, but due to the rarity of the diagnosis, the material was sent for an immunohistochemical study in a reference laboratory.\nThe immunohistochemical study presented expression of Ki-67, synaptophysin (), product of the INI-1 gene and 40, 48, 50 and 50.6 kDa cytokeratin, being the antigen gp100 focally positive (). Besides that, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), desmin, myogenin, S-100 protein and homeobox protein (transcription factor gene, clone 74.5A5) were negative. The diagnosis of medulloblastoma with melanocytic differentiation (grade IV, WHO) was suggested. However, after a review at the Neuropathology Service of Emory University, in Atlanta, USA, the diagnosis of MNTI was established.\nThree months after the procedure, the lesion relapsed at the primary site and a second surgery was performed with complete removal of the tumour. After 2 months, seizures started to evolve in the patient and a new relapse was observed. A brain and cervical spine MRI demonstrated a heterogeneous and expansive neoplastic lesion with an epicentre on the right side of the posterior cranial fossa, which showed an increase in the dimensions (5.4 × 5.2 × 4.3 cm) when compared to previous exams. This determined a compression on the cerebral aqueduct causing obstructive hydrocephalus and signs of obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal cerebrospinal fluid flow, requiring a new neurosurgical procedure.\nThe postoperative revaluation revealed the persistence of the extracranial component in the cervical region with a slight increase in its dimensions, appearance of the cavitation area and necrosis. MRI revealed an increase in the number and extension of the right cervical lymph nodes. Posteriorly, the patient underwent a new surgery for tumour excision.\nAfterward, the child was referred for assessment by the paediatric oncology team. Although it is considered to be a benign pathology, chemotherapy treatment was proposed due to the relapse and limitations of the new surgical approach. Six cycles of the chemotherapy were performed with a 21-day interval. First cycle: Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose, Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2/day (VAC); Second to sixth cycle: Cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2/dose, Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose, Carboplatin 450 mg/m2, evolving with an apparent resolution of lesions.\nUnfortunately, the patient presented a local recurrence (in the craniectomy region) 5 months after the end of the treatment, so a new surgery was performed. The morphological and immunohistochemical patterns were compatible with the recurrence of MNTI and, therefore, were chosen to restart the chemotherapy based on the high-risk sarcomas protocol of the hospital.\nDespite the treatment, the patient developed leptomeningeal dissemination, which was manifested by the motor deficit, walking difficulties, inability to stand and seizures that were difficult to control. We chose to use palliative 3D conformal radiotherapy (skull + spine) (4,350 cGy + boost 1,800 cGy).

A 1-year-old boy was referred for evaluation by the neurosurgery team with an expansile nodular lesion in the right retroauricular region. The mother stated that a retroauricular bulging has been present in this region since his birth; however, the professionals who were consulted at the time believed there was no clinical significance. The neuropsychomotor development (NPMD) of the child was normal for his age and he had no previous significant history of pathology. His maternal uncle was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia at the age of 9. Germline genetic testings were not performed.\nThe initial skull radiography showed bone sclerosis associated with probable intracranial calcification in the right retroauricular region at the parieto-occipital transition. The ultrasound highlighted a homogeneous and regular hypoechoic nodule, with 32 × 26 × 12 mm, located below the subcutaneous tissue in close contact with the adjacent bone cortex. The colour Doppler imaging identified peripheral vessels adjacent to the main lesion. Computerised tomography revealed a 4.2 × 4.5 × 3.6 cm of a neoplastic lesion with an epicentre on the skullcap of the right temporo-occipital transition with intracranial and extracranial expansion; the lesion was compressing the adjacent cephalic structures apparently in a supratentorial compartment (). Brain magnetic resonance displayed an intracranial component in the posterior cranial fossa, compressing the adjacent cerebellar hemisphere. In the middle cranial fossa, the component was rectifying the turns of the posterior aspect of the anterior temporal pole on this side (). Among the diagnostic hypotheses were the fibrosarcoma, the meningioma, and the eosinophilic granuloma.\nThe patient underwent surgery and intraoperative frozen section. The histopathology of the tissue revealed a biphasic tumour tangential to the resection margins, characterised by small, round and blue cells, as well as pseudoglandular arrangement with pigmented cells infiltrating the bone and muscle tissue (). We initially concluded that it was a MNTI, but due to the rarity of the diagnosis, the material was sent for an immunohistochemical study in a reference laboratory.\nThe immunohistochemical study presented expression of Ki-67, synaptophysin (), product of the INI-1 gene and 40, 48, 50 and 50.6 kDa cytokeratin, being the antigen gp100 focally positive (). Besides that, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), desmin, myogenin, S-100 protein and homeobox protein (transcription factor gene, clone 74.5A5) were negative. The diagnosis of medulloblastoma with melanocytic differentiation (grade IV, WHO) was suggested. However, after a review at the Neuropathology Service of Emory University, in Atlanta, USA, the diagnosis of MNTI was established.\nThree months after the procedure, the lesion relapsed at the primary site and a second surgery was performed with complete removal of the tumour. After 2 months, seizures started to evolve in the patient and a new relapse was observed. A brain and cervical spine MRI demonstrated a heterogeneous and expansive neoplastic lesion with an epicentre on the right side of the posterior cranial fossa, which showed an increase in the dimensions (5.4 × 5.2 × 4.3 cm) when compared to previous exams. This determined a compression on the cerebral aqueduct causing obstructive hydrocephalus and signs of obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal cerebrospinal fluid flow, requiring a new neurosurgical procedure.\nThe postoperative revaluation revealed the persistence of the extracranial component in the cervical region with a slight increase in its dimensions, appearance of the cavitation area and necrosis. MRI revealed an increase in the number and extension of the right cervical lymph nodes. Posteriorly, the patient underwent a new surgery for tumour excision.\nAfterward, the child was referred for assessment by the paediatric oncology team. Although it is considered to be a benign pathology, chemotherapy treatment was proposed due to the relapse and limitations of the new surgical approach. Six cycles of the chemotherapy were performed with a 21-day interval. First cycle: Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose, Doxorubicin 30 mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2/day (VAC); Second to sixth cycle: Cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2/dose, Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/dose, Carboplatin 450 mg/m2, evolving with an apparent resolution of lesions.\nUnfortunately, the patient presented a local recurrence (in the craniectomy region) 5 months after the end of the treatment, so a new surgery was performed. The morphological and immunohistochemical patterns were compatible with the recurrence of MNTI and, therefore, were chosen to restart the chemotherapy based on the high-risk sarcomas protocol of the hospital.\nDespite the treatment, the patient developed leptomeningeal dissemination, which was manifested by the motor deficit, walking difficulties, inability to stand and seizures that were difficult to control. We chose to use palliative 3D conformal radiotherapy (skull + spine) (4,350 cGy + boost 1,800 cGy). The patient presented an improvement of the neurological symptoms with the recovery of the motor skills and the control of seizures. The expectant management with radiological control of the lesions was adopted.\nAfter 3 years, control imaging exams revealed signs of supratentorial and infratentorial leptomeningeal impregnation, suggesting a postoperative scar (). Outpatient follow-up was selected since the patient remained asymptomatic and there is no literature supporting other therapeutics.\nThe presentation of this case was authorised by the mother of the child, as well as by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Hospital approached in this study.

186449,"A 15-year-old girl visited the orthopedic service because of severe knee pain after a sudden fall while heading downstairs, and she was unable to stretch her leg. The patient had a history of dislocation of the patella 2 weeks ago. Physical examination showed tenderness on palpation over the upper pole of the patella and absence of active movement of the knee accompanied by swelling and joint effusion. A plain radiograph showed an avulsed fragment of the superior pole of the patella (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a superior pole patellar avulsion fracture and dysfunction of the knee extensor mechanism (Fig. ). There were no signs of damage to the articular cartilage, meniscus, and cruciate ligament caused by previous dislocation.\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient underwent open surgery for reduction of the patellar fracture and reconstruction of the knee extension apparatus through an anterior approach. All of the above-mentioned imaging findings were further confirmed during surgery. Through a midline incision above the quadriceps tendon, careful dissection was performed to expose the injury site. Intraoperatively, a sleeve-like piece of bone was detected above the patella, and the proximal quadriceps tendon was attached to the bone piece (Fig. ). Then, complete removal of the blood clot and tissue debris was performed in the joint cavity and around the torn ends of the quadriceps tendon. Patellar retinaculum and quadriceps tendon with the patellar fracture piece was meticulously repaired and secured to the main patellar body by 2 Bio Composite suture anchors (Arthrex, Naples, FL) using a modified Mason–Allen stitch and was augmented by performing the figure-of-8 technique (Fig. ).\nPostoperatively, the patient's knee was maintained in full extension using a knee brace, and weight-bearing was prohibited until 6 weeks after surgery. The passive range of motion exercise of the knee was started on the first day after surgery, and it was gradually progressed to full-scale motion as the tolerance improved. During the first 6 weeks of surgery, the patient's main activities included patellar mobility exercises, knee passive range of motion exercises, and quadriceps activation exercises. After 6 weeks, the patient was referred to the rehabilitation department for restoration of complete knee activity and initiation of muscle strength training. The patient was allowed to gradually resume sports when the normal strength, stability, and knee range of motion were comparable to those on the contralateral side.\nSix months after the operation, the knee function was fully restored, there was absence of pain and swelling, and the patient was able to return to sports.","{'visit motivation': 'Severe knee pain after a sudden fall and inability to stretch her leg', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Open surgery for reduction of the patellar fracture and reconstruction of the knee extension apparatus', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Orthopedic service'}], 'patient information': {'age': '15', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'History of dislocation of the patella 2 weeks ago', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Superior pole patellar avulsion fracture and dysfunction of the knee extensor mechanism', 'Type': 'Open surgery for reduction of the patellar fracture and reconstruction of the knee extension apparatus', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'Surgery confirmed imaging findings; dissection exposed the injury site; a sleeve-like piece of bone detected above the patella with the proximal quadriceps tendon attached; removal of blood clot and tissue debris; repair and securement of patellar retinaculum and quadriceps tendon with the patellar fracture piece to the main patellar body by 2 Bio Composite suture anchors using a modified Mason–Allen stitch and figure-of-8 technique'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Knee pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'Severe', 'location': 'Knee', 'time': 'After a sudden fall', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Heading downstairs', 'details': 'Unable to stretch her leg'}, {'name of symptom': 'Tenderness on palpation', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Over the upper pole of the patella', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name of symptom': 'Absence of active movement of the knee', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Knee', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Accompanied by swelling and joint effusion'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Tenderness on palpation over the upper pole of the patella, absence of active movement of the knee, swelling, and joint effusion', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Plain radiograph', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'An avulsed fragment of the superior pole of the patella', 'condition': 'Patellar avulsion fracture', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Confirmed a superior pole patellar avulsion fracture and dysfunction of the knee extensor mechanism', 'condition': 'Patellar avulsion fracture and dysfunction of the knee extensor mechanism', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'No signs of damage to the articular cartilage, meniscus, and cruciate ligament caused by previous dislocation'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Surgery', 'related condition': 'Superior pole patellar avulsion fracture and dysfunction of the knee extensor mechanism', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To reduce the patellar fracture and reconstruct the knee extension apparatus', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'Postoperative maintenance of knee in full extension using a knee brace, prohibited weight-bearing until 6 weeks after surgery, and passive range of motion exercise of the knee started on the first day after surgery'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Are there any behaviors that affect the symptom (e.g., activities that worsen it)?', 'What specific symptom(s) did the patient report?', 'Where is the symptom located (e.g., body part)?', 'What is the intensity of the symptom (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)?', 'How does the symptom change over time (e.g., constant, intermittent, worsening)?', 'When did the symptom(s) start?'], ['How long did the patient stay in the care center?

84802,"A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our department with a 4-day history of anorexia, weakness, and persistent coughing. She had a clear medical history without cardiac, pulmonary, or any other problems. During the clinical examination a large mass was palpated in the lower abdomen. A simple chest X-ray () was conducted which revealed a large, solid lesion in the median lobe of the right lung that was consistent with lung cancer. The laboratory findings were normal. A biopsy from the right bronchus was obtained by bronchoscopy and showed no malignancy as also confirmed by the bronchial cytological result. The patient was further submitted to a colonoscopy where no abnormalities were obtained. An ultrasound of the upper and lower abdomen revealed a solid, promiscuous lesion of 16 × 14 cm in dimensions located into the small pelvis, surrounding the uterus and the ovaries. The CT scan of the thorax () showed a 4 cm multilobed mass behind and under the hilum of the right lung and multiple nodular lesions in both lungs. The abdominal CT scan () confirmed the presence of the known mass and revealed no lymphadenopathy. Consequently, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, during which a large, encapsulated mass was found to emerge deep from the small pelvis, extend up to the umbilicus region, and infiltrate the uterus, the adnexa, and the right pelvic wall, displacing upwards and to the left the rectum and the sigmoid colon. During the surgical manipulations both ureters were inadvertently injured and surgically repaired. Appendectomy was preformed, while a glandule located at the right pelvic wall was removed. Biopsies from the surgical specimen including the appendix and the glandule were sent. The postoperative period was uneventful. On the ninth postoperative day the patient complained about two small-sized painful tumorlike lesions located in the lower jaw (). Because of the progressive increase in their size, the lesions were removed and sent for biopsy. A few days later the results from the pathological examination of the surgical specimen were obtained and revealed an adenosarcoma of the right ovary, consisting of high-degree homologous and heterologous sarcomatous elements, expanding to the neighboring fibroid-fat tissue and too close (almost in contact) to the right ureter, part of which was incorporated into the specimen. Both the uterus and the fallopian tubes were free of malignancy. The biopsy from the glandule of the right pelvic wall showed extended infiltration from a sarcoma with morphological characters of a rhabdomyosarcoma. Finally, the appendix was free of malignancy. The patient was discharged on the 18th postoperative day.

A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our department with a 4-day history of anorexia, weakness, and persistent coughing. She had a clear medical history without cardiac, pulmonary, or any other problems. During the clinical examination a large mass was palpated in the lower abdomen. A simple chest X-ray () was conducted which revealed a large, solid lesion in the median lobe of the right lung that was consistent with lung cancer. The laboratory findings were normal. A biopsy from the right bronchus was obtained by bronchoscopy and showed no malignancy as also confirmed by the bronchial cytological result. The patient was further submitted to a colonoscopy where no abnormalities were obtained. An ultrasound of the upper and lower abdomen revealed a solid, promiscuous lesion of 16 × 14 cm in dimensions located into the small pelvis, surrounding the uterus and the ovaries. The CT scan of the thorax () showed a 4 cm multilobed mass behind and under the hilum of the right lung and multiple nodular lesions in both lungs. The abdominal CT scan () confirmed the presence of the known mass and revealed no lymphadenopathy. Consequently, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, during which a large, encapsulated mass was found to emerge deep from the small pelvis, extend up to the umbilicus region, and infiltrate the uterus, the adnexa, and the right pelvic wall, displacing upwards and to the left the rectum and the sigmoid colon. During the surgical manipulations both ureters were inadvertently injured and surgically repaired. Appendectomy was preformed, while a glandule located at the right pelvic wall was removed. Biopsies from the surgical specimen including the appendix and the glandule were sent. The postoperative period was uneventful. On the ninth postoperative day the patient complained about two small-sized painful tumorlike lesions located in the lower jaw (). Because of the progressive increase in their size, the lesions were removed and sent for biopsy. A few days later the results from the pathological examination of the surgical specimen were obtained and revealed an adenosarcoma of the right ovary, consisting of high-degree homologous and heterologous sarcomatous elements, expanding to the neighboring fibroid-fat tissue and too close (almost in contact) to the right ureter, part of which was incorporated into the specimen. Both the uterus and the fallopian tubes were free of malignancy. The biopsy from the glandule of the right pelvic wall showed extended infiltration from a sarcoma with morphological characters of a rhabdomyosarcoma. Finally, the appendix was free of malignancy. The patient was discharged on the 18th postoperative day. The glandules removed from the patient's mouth were found to harbor a malignant mesenchymatous neoplasm that represented a metastatic lesion from the known sarcoma. Within a month from her discharge, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of intense headache, vertigo, and vomiting. The brain CT scan showed metastases and 4 days later she passed away.

58910,"A 54-year-old female patient presented with gradually progressive painless lump in the left breast for 3 months. She had no specific family history or any other systemic symptoms. On clinical examination, there was a firm, mobile, nontender breast lump in upper inner quadrant of the left breast measuring approximately 2.5 × 2 cm with overlying skin being normal and no axillary lymphadenopathy or swelling in the contralateral breast. Mammogram showed ill-defined branching soft-tissue density with scattered areas of calcification with a query of dilated duct in upper inner quadrant of the left breast. Ultrasonography revealed a cyst in upper inner quadrant measuring 3 × 2 cm containing echogenic debris along with a hypoechoic solid appearing lesion seen in continuity with its wall measuring 2.6 × 1.5 cm. Final impression suggested possibility of malignancy (BIRADS 4C) with a suspicion of intraductal lesion.\nCore needle biopsy was performed which showed fragmented cores composed of predominantly of fibrocollagenous tissue with benign ducts interspersed in the tissue. A separate small sheet of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm was seen. A suspicion of malignancy was raised, and repeat biopsy from representative site was advised (Figure ). On repeat core needle biopsy, again a small focus of atypical cells of above-mentioned morphology was seen. Some extracellular keratin could also be appreciated (Figure ). Hence, a possibility of metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation was considered.\nWide local excision was performed, the cut surface of which showed a cystic lesion filled with whitish material along with presence of a grey white well-defined firm area measuring 3 × 2.2 cm. Microscopic examination revealed a lesion filled centrally with keratinous debris and lined by atypical squamous cells, infiltrating the surrounding stroma as islands and clusters (Figure (C, D)). No other component was seen, and overlying skin was also not involved. Immunohistochemically, these tumor cells were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and her 2 neu with high-proliferation rate (Ki 67 index 60%, Figure ).

189831,"A 64-year-old right-handed retired male teacher was referred to our clinic with an inability to flex the interphalangeal (IP) joint of his left thumb. One week previously, he was gardening. He had flexed his thumb around the stem of a firmly embedded weed, and as he pulled hard, he felt a sudden pop in his left thumb and found he could not flex his left thumb. Although he often played saxophone, he could not recall any specific episode of pain or discomfort within the left thumb. There was no evidence of any history of rheumatoid or other inflammatory arthritis and his rheumatoid serology was normal.\nUpon examination, no specific painful swelling in the left thumb was detected. However, the patient was unable to actively flex his thumb at the IP joint (Fig. ). He had full passive range of motion of IP joint.\nInitial plain left thumb radiographs revealed no bony abnormalities resulting in secondary tendon rupture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed complete FPL tendon rupture at the level of the distal one-third of the proximal phalanx and the proximal end of the ruptured tendon was retracted to the level of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint (Fig. ).\nWith the patient under general anesthesia, the FPL tendon was explored through a volar zig-zag incision. During the operation, the FPL tendon was found to be ruptured completely. Gross examination revealed a slightly yellowish denaturated tissue at the distal end of the ruptured tendon and the gap of the ruptured ends was interposed by a fibrous tissue (Fig. ). No bony prominence was observed throughout the excursion of the tendon. We excised the denaturated tissue from the distal end of the ruptured tendon and sent it for histological examination. FPL tendon was repaired primarily via modified Becker method (Fig. ).

A 64-year-old right-handed retired male teacher was referred to our clinic with an inability to flex the interphalangeal (IP) joint of his left thumb. One week previously, he was gardening. He had flexed his thumb around the stem of a firmly embedded weed, and as he pulled hard, he felt a sudden pop in his left thumb and found he could not flex his left thumb. Although he often played saxophone, he could not recall any specific episode of pain or discomfort within the left thumb. There was no evidence of any history of rheumatoid or other inflammatory arthritis and his rheumatoid serology was normal.\nUpon examination, no specific painful swelling in the left thumb was detected. However, the patient was unable to actively flex his thumb at the IP joint (Fig. ). He had full passive range of motion of IP joint.\nInitial plain left thumb radiographs revealed no bony abnormalities resulting in secondary tendon rupture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed complete FPL tendon rupture at the level of the distal one-third of the proximal phalanx and the proximal end of the ruptured tendon was retracted to the level of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint (Fig. ).\nWith the patient under general anesthesia, the FPL tendon was explored through a volar zig-zag incision. During the operation, the FPL tendon was found to be ruptured completely. Gross examination revealed a slightly yellowish denaturated tissue at the distal end of the ruptured tendon and the gap of the ruptured ends was interposed by a fibrous tissue (Fig. ). No bony prominence was observed throughout the excursion of the tendon. We excised the denaturated tissue from the distal end of the ruptured tendon and sent it for histological examination. FPL tendon was repaired primarily via modified Becker method (Fig. ). Histopathological examination revealed normal vasculature in the tendon tissue and degenerative changes associated with lipid deposits in the tendon tissue (Fig. ).\nPostoperatively, the left thumb was immobilized in a below-elbow plaster splint with extension block for 1 week, followed by dynamic splinting recommended for another 6 weeks and unrestricted full active motion at week 7.\nAt 12-month follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic and had excellent IP joint range of motion (0°–40°) in his left thumb. The wrist grip strength was 30 kg (28 kg in the Rt.) and the thumb pinch strength was 5.7 kg (4.7 kg in the Rt.). The Quick DASH score was 0 (Fig. ).

26068,"This report describes an unusual case of a 93-year-old female cadaver with a large SOM occupying the left middle cranial fossa and invading the left orbit. Her cause of death was listed as blunt force trauma of which we found no evidence.\nRoutine dissection of the cadaver indicated unilateral proptosis of the left eyeball (Figure ). To investigate the cause of the structural deformity, the scalp was reflected, and evidence of a previous craniotomy was found in the left temporal and parietal bones (Figure ). Upon removal of the calvaria, the brain parenchyma was carefully examined. Though there was no evidence of tumor invasion into the brain parenchyma, it was clear that the ventral aspect of the left temporal lobe had been severely compressed by the meningioma (Figure ). The depression formed by the tumor in the temporal lobe had an estimated size of 4.5 cm anterior to posterior (Figure ). Mild compression of the left frontal lobe was also noted (Figure ).\nExamination of the skull base revealed a large cauliflower-like mass extended along the sphenoid wing, nearly filling the left middle cranial fossa. The lobulated tumor appeared brownish-white, had a firm to hard consistency, and had an estimated size of 4.5 cm anterior to posterior and 5 cm in width (Figure ). The tumor had further extended through the superior orbital fissure and invaded the anterior cranial fossa. The meningioma occupied the left orbit, causing anterior displacement of the left eyeball and subsequent stretching of the left optic nerve. The complete size of the tumor spanning from the middle cranial fossa to the anterior cranial fossa was estimated to be 9.5 cm anterior to posterior (Figure ).\nHistopathological examination of a section taken from the skull-base tumor revealed a sparse distribution of the whorled cellular pattern that is typical of meningiomas, thin collagenous septae separating tumor cell lobules, and lymphoplasmocytes (Figure ). No psammoma bodies were found. These features led to the classification of the tumor as a grade I meningothelial meningioma. Histological cross sections of the left and right optic nerves demonstrated that the affected left optic nerve displayed decreased cellularity, loss of axons, and increased connective tissue deposits compared to the normal right optic nerve (Figure ). The left optic nerve sheath was also thickened as compared to the contralateral nerve. Additionally, the walls of the central retinal artery in the left optic nerve appeared acellular in comparison to those present on the right side (Figure ).","{'visit motivation': 'None', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '93', 'sex': 'female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'None', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Evidence of a previous craniotomy', 'Type': 'Craniotomy', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'Found in the left temporal and parietal bones'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'unilateral proptosis', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'left eyeball', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Caused by a large SOM occupying the left middle cranial fossa and invading the left orbit'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Routine dissection', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Indicated unilateral proptosis of the left eyeball'}, {'name': 'Examination of the skull base', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Revealed a large cauliflower-like mass extended along the sphenoid wing, nearly filling the left middle cranial fossa and invading the left orbit'}, {'name': 'Histopathological examination', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Revealed a sparse distribution of the whorled cellular pattern typical of meningiomas, thin collagenous septae separating tumor cell lobules, and lymphoplasmocytes'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'Meningioma', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Large SOM occupying the left middle cranial fossa and invading the left orbit, causing severe compression of the left temporal lobe and mild compression of the left frontal lobe'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'None', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'Death', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'Cause of death was listed as blunt force trauma, of which no evidence was found'}}","[[""Does the note mention the patient's exercise habits?"", 'Does the patient have any allergies to medications or other substances?', ""Does the note mention the patient's alcohol consumption habits (e.g., frequency, amount)?"", ""Does the note mention the patient's smoking history?

199785,"A previously healthy 35-year-old African American male presented with a one-month history of worsening lower back and bilateral lower extremity pain, intermittent night sweats, and 32 kg unintentional weight loss over the course of a year. He did not have saddle anesthesia or urinary or fecal incontinence. He was initially seen in a primary care clinic and was diagnosed with sciatica. As symptoms continued to worsen, he underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar scan as an outpatient that was concerning osseous spinal metastasis. He was started on prednisone 10 mg daily and was referred to the oncology clinic at our center. Prednisone gave him minimal symptomatic relief. While waiting to be seen in the oncology clinic, the patient had an episode of leg weakness with near-fall prompting him to present to the emergency department of our hospital and was admitted for further evaluation. His vital signs were stable. He had no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes. Neurological exam was normal with intact strength and sensation in both lower extremities.\nHis complete blood count and serum electrolytes were normal including a normal serum calcium level at 8.1 mg/dL. He tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed several enhancing lesions in T11, T12, L3, L4 vertebral bodies, right sacrum, and ilium that were concerning metastatic disease. There was effacement of the right lateral recess and right neural foramen at the L3-L4 and effacement of the left lateral recess and left neural foramen at the L4-L5 due to tumor retropulsion (Figures –). In addition, a small epidural tumor was noted at the T5 vertebral level without significant spinal canal stenosis or cord compression. Imaging was also concerning osseous metastasis involving the sternum and multiple ribs. Incidentally, narrowing of the neural foramen at left T2-T3 and right C7-T1 and T5-T6 levels was also noted. Since the findings were concerning diffuse metastatic disease, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed and showed bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, mild cardiomegaly, and dilated main pulmonary artery measuring 3.6 cm (Figures and ). Enlarged liver measuring 18.1 cm, enlarged spleen measuring 12.4 cm, and multiple bilateral enlarged pelvic sidewall, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes concerning lymphoma or metastatic disease are shown in . Ultrasound of the scrotum did not reveal any testicular masses.\nHe underwent extensive screening for hematologic and solid tumor malignancies including serum protein electrophoresis, urine immunofixation, beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin hormone levels, and fecal occult blood test that were all negative. He subsequently underwent a CT-guided core needle biopsy of the left iliac crest lesion that was significant for noncaseating and necrotizing granulomas. Histochemical stains for Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) and Ziehl-Neelsen stains were negative for fungal elements and acid-fast bacilli, respectively. Due to high suspicion of malignancy, he also underwent an endoscopic bronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration of the inferior mediastinal lymph node which found non-necrotizing granulomas but did not reveal any malignant cells (Figures –). Fungal culture and acid-fast bacilli culture from the transbronchial aspirate were again negative. Serum ACE level was 62 U/L (normal 14–82 U/L).\nNeurosurgery was consulted, and they did not recommend any acute neurosurgical intervention. The patient was discharged with follow-up in pulmonology clinic. Since there was concern that his steroid therapy prior to admission could have masked lymphoma, he had a left inguinal node excisional biopsy, a month later, that showed necrotizing and non-necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenopathy and was negative for acid-fast or fungal microorganisms. Since there was concern for a process with high metabolic activity, he also had an 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron electron topography (PET) scan that was significant for extensive hypermetabolic osseous and nodal disease ().","{'visit motivation': 'Worsening lower back and bilateral lower extremity pain, intermittent night sweats, and significant weight loss', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Episode of leg weakness with near-fall', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Emergency department of the hospital'}], 'patient information': {'age': '35-year-old', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'African American', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Previously healthy', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Lower back and bilateral lower extremity pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'Worsening', 'location': 'Lower back and bilateral lower extremities', 'time': 'One-month history', 'temporalisation': 'Intermittent', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': '32 kg unintentional weight loss over the course of a year, intermittent night sweats'}, {'name of symptom': 'Intermittent night sweats', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'One-month history', 'temporalisation': 'Intermittent', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name of symptom': 'Unintentional weight loss', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'Over the course of a year', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': '32 kg weight loss'}, {'name of symptom': 'Leg weakness with near-fall', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Legs', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Prompted visit to the emergency department'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Neurological exam', 'result': 'Normal', 'details': 'Intact strength and sensation in both lower extremities'}, {'name': 'Palpation of lymph nodes', 'result': 'No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Complete blood count and serum electrolytes', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Normal', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Including a normal serum calcium level at 8.1 mg/dL'}, {'test': 'HIV 1 and 2 antibodies', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Negative', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'CT scan of the lumbar spine', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Concerning for osseous spinal metastasis', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Performed as an outpatient'}, {'test': 'MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Several enhancing lesions in T11, T12, L3, L4 vertebral bodies, right sacrum, and ilium concerning for metastatic disease; effacement of the right lateral recess and right neural foramen at L3-L4 and effacement of the left lateral recess and left neural foramen at L4-L5 due to tumor retropulsion; small epidural tumor at T5 vertebral level without significant spinal canal stenosis or cord compression; osseous metastasis involving the sternum and multiple ribs', 'condition': 'Metastatic disease', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Incidentally, narrowing of the neural foramen at'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Prednisone', 'related condition': 'Sciatica and suspected metastatic disease', 'dosage': '10 mg', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'Daily', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Symptomatic relief', 'reaction to treatment': 'Minimal symptomatic relief', 'details': 'Started after initial diagnosis of sciatica'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'Referred to the oncology clinic', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?', 'What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?'], ['Why was the patient discharged from the care center?', ""What is a brief summary of the patient's condition and treatment plan at discharge?"", 'Was the patient referred to any other healthcare providers or specialists?', 'Are there any follow-up appointments or instructions for the patient?']]",Medical Examinations,Discharge,"

A previously healthy 35-year-old African American male presented with a one-month history of worsening lower back and bilateral lower extremity pain, intermittent night sweats, and 32 kg unintentional weight loss over the course of a year. He did not have saddle anesthesia or urinary or fecal incontinence. He was initially seen in a primary care clinic and was diagnosed with sciatica. As symptoms continued to worsen, he underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar scan as an outpatient that was concerning osseous spinal metastasis. He was started on prednisone 10 mg daily and was referred to the oncology clinic at our center. Prednisone gave him minimal symptomatic relief. While waiting to be seen in the oncology clinic, the patient had an episode of leg weakness with near-fall prompting him to present to the emergency department of our hospital and was admitted for further evaluation. His vital signs were stable. He had no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes. Neurological exam was normal with intact strength and sensation in both lower extremities.\nHis complete blood count and serum electrolytes were normal including a normal serum calcium level at 8.1 mg/dL. He tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 antibodies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed several enhancing lesions in T11, T12, L3, L4 vertebral bodies, right sacrum, and ilium that were concerning metastatic disease. There was effacement of the right lateral recess and right neural foramen at the L3-L4 and effacement of the left lateral recess and left neural foramen at the L4-L5 due to tumor retropulsion (Figures –). In addition, a small epidural tumor was noted at the T5 vertebral level without significant spinal canal stenosis or cord compression. Imaging was also concerning osseous metastasis involving the sternum and multiple ribs. Incidentally, narrowing of the neural foramen at left T2-T3 and right C7-T1 and T5-T6 levels was also noted. Since the findings were concerning diffuse metastatic disease, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed and showed bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, mild cardiomegaly, and dilated main pulmonary artery measuring 3.6 cm (Figures and ). Enlarged liver measuring 18.1 cm, enlarged spleen measuring 12.4 cm, and multiple bilateral enlarged pelvic sidewall, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes concerning lymphoma or metastatic disease are shown in . Ultrasound of the scrotum did not reveal any testicular masses.\nHe underwent extensive screening for hematologic and solid tumor malignancies including serum protein electrophoresis, urine immunofixation, beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin hormone levels, and fecal occult blood test that were all negative. He subsequently underwent a CT-guided core needle biopsy of the left iliac crest lesion that was significant for noncaseating and necrotizing granulomas. Histochemical stains for Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) and Ziehl-Neelsen stains were negative for fungal elements and acid-fast bacilli, respectively. Due to high suspicion of malignancy, he also underwent an endoscopic bronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration of the inferior mediastinal lymph node which found non-necrotizing granulomas but did not reveal any malignant cells (Figures –). Fungal culture and acid-fast bacilli culture from the transbronchial aspirate were again negative. Serum ACE level was 62 U/L (normal 14–82 U/L).\nNeurosurgery was consulted, and they did not recommend any acute neurosurgical intervention. The patient was discharged with follow-up in pulmonology clinic. Since there was concern that his steroid therapy prior to admission could have masked lymphoma, he had a left inguinal node excisional biopsy, a month later, that showed necrotizing and non-necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenopathy and was negative for acid-fast or fungal microorganisms. Since there was concern for a process with high metabolic activity, he also had an 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron electron topography (PET) scan that was significant for extensive hypermetabolic osseous and nodal disease ().

129165,"Patient is a 55-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She had been experiencing diffuse mild abdominal pain for the past year and reported that in the last 4 months the pain became more intense and was experiencing weight loss. On clinical examination, a dehydrated, malnourished and tachycardic patient with abdominal tenderness and a mass in the abdomen was discovered. She had leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and a heterogeneous mass with peripheral vascularity attached to the small bowel was revealed by echography. A contrast-enhanced CT confirmed a 10 × 11 × 5 cm3 mass in the transverse colon near the hepatic flexure that invaded the small bowel mesentery (Fig. A). The mass had a cavity filled with fluid and gas. Free abdominal fluid and some dilated loops of bowel were also observed (Fig. B). With these findings and after adequate resuscitation, surgery was decided. At laparotomy, 300 ml of purulent liquid in the abdominal cavity and a 10 × 10 × 5 cm3 blueish colonic mass, near the hepatic flexure that invaded the jejunum 50 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, was discovered. Also, a 1 × 2 cm2 perforation was found in the mass from where fecaloid fluid poured into the abdomen. During surgery, an en-bloc resection of the colonic mass with the compromised jejunum was completed, the intestinal transit was restored with mechanical staples and an exhaustive washing of the abdominal cavity was done. Also, a drain was left near the colonic anastomosis. Pathology reported a 10 × 10 × 5 cm3 inflammatory colonic mass (Fig. C). The wall of the colon had necrotic patches (Fig. A). The jejunum wall had an inflammatory reaction that narrowed its lumen, nevertheless, no necrosis was found (Fig. B). The 3 × 3 × 2 cm3 cavity in the colonic mass contained purulent material and two adult Ascaris lumbricoides of 15 and 7 cm (Fig. C), one of which had multiple eggs in its uterine tubule (Fig. A). Beside this cavity, a 1 × 2 cm2 perforation was discovered. Bowel perforation due to roundworms, with colonic wall necrosis, was the final diagnosis.\nThe postoperative period was uneventful, the patient was discharged after a 14-day antibiotic an anthelmintic treatment, and once full diet resumed. Nevertheless, 1 month later, she returned to the emergency with fever and abdominal pain. On clinical examination, abdominal tenderness and fecaloid fluid drained from the wound was discovered. Re-laparotomy was performed, a frozen abdomen with complete wound dehiscence was observed, the small bowel was matted together, covered in exudate, and had a granular appearance. An enterocutaneous fistula from the site of the colocolonic anastomosis from which feces drained and a live parasite emerged was unveiled. After extensive irrigation, the skin defect was closed, and the fistula was managed like wound ostomy in the midline (Fig. B). Following this surgery, patient had a good clinical development. Three months later on, follow-up controls patient is doing well (Fig. C).","{'visit motivation': 'Abdominal pain', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Intense abdominal pain and weight loss', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '55', 'sex': 'female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'None', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Inflammatory colonic mass with invasion into the jejunum and perforation', 'Type': 'En-bloc resection of the colonic mass with the compromised jejunum, restoration of intestinal transit with mechanical staples, and exhaustive washing of the abdominal cavity', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'A drain was left near the colonic anastomosis.'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Abdominal pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'Mild, becoming more intense over the last 4 months', 'location': 'Diffuse', 'time': 'Past year', 'temporalisation': 'Increasing intensity over the past 4 months', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Associated with weight loss'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Clinical examination', 'result': 'Dehydrated, malnourished, tachycardic, abdominal tenderness, abdominal mass', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Laboratory test', 'result': 'Leukocytosis with neutrophilia', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Echography', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Heterogeneous mass with peripheral vascularity attached to the small bowel', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Contrast-enhanced CT', 'severity': 'None', 'result': '10 × 11 × 5 cm3 mass in the transverse colon near the hepatic flexure invading the small bowel mesentery, with a cavity filled with fluid and gas, free abdominal fluid, and some dilated loops of bowel', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Laparotomy', 'severity': 'None', 'result': '300 ml of purulent liquid in the abdominal cavity, a 10 × 10 × 5 cm3 blueish colonic mass near the hepatic flexure invading the jejunum 50 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, and a 1 × 2 cm2 perforation in the mass', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Surgery', 'related condition': 'Inflammatory colonic mass with invasion into the jejunum and perforation', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To remove the mass and restore intestinal function', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'En-bloc resection of the colonic mass with the compromised jejunum, restoration of intestinal transit with mechanical staples, exhaustive washing of the abdominal cavity, and placement of a drain near the colonic anastomosis.'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Did the patient experience any side effects or reactions to the treatment?', 'What specific condition was the treatment intended to address?', 'How long did the patient receive the treatment?', 'What was the dosage of the medication or treatment?', 'Why was this treatment initiated?', 'How often was the medication or treatment administered?', 'When was the treatment initiated?', 'What medication or treatment was administered?', 'Are there any additional details mentioned about the treatment (e.g., route of administration, specific instructions)?'], [""What are the patient's main symptoms or concerns upon admission?"", 'Does the note mention any significant family history of medical conditions?', 'Does the note mention any relevant past medical conditions (e.g., surgeries, chronic illnesses)?', 'Did the patient travel recently, and could it be relevant to the current condition?

158396,"A 62-year-old man from Mongolia visited Wonkwang University School of Medicine and Hospital with a cystostomy tube. His past medical history included a TURP 3 years previously for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A proximal penile urethral stricture had developed after the previous TURP. At the first visit, the patient had normal vital signs, and his blood tests showed a hemoglobin value of 13.0 g/dL and serum creatinine of 0.80 mg/dL. The results of a urine analysis were normal, and the results of urine culture tests were negative. A retrograde urethrogram showed an approximately 2 cm sized stricture in the proximal penile urethra ().\nThe surgery was performed with the patient under spinal anesthesia in the lithotomy position. First, a rectangular 3 cm sized flap was drawn on the stretched skin of the posterior scrotal face, centered over the mid raphe, for tubular urethroplasty (A). The skin strip was tubularized on a 16 Fr catheter with 5-zero absorbable continuous polyglycolic acid sutures and the avoidance of skin eversion. A second plane was made by suturing above the outer edges of the flap with interrupted polyglycolic acid sutures, and the tube was formed by a thick musculocutaneous wall (). Following segmental urethrectomy (), the tubularized flap was interposed by rotating it 135 degrees on its perineal scrotal base, which inverted its 2 ends. Proximal and distal anastomoses with the healthy urethra were performed with 5-zero absorbable interrupted sutures ().\nThere were no complications, and no abnormal blood test results were noted after the surgery. A 16 Fr Foley catheter was kept in place for 2 weeks, and a voiding cystogram performed 2 weeks after the surgery showed no leaking of contrast media around the urethra (). The patient returned home after removal of the Foley catheter and experienced subsequent symptoms of an overactive bladder for which he was prescribed anticholinergics.\nIn the second case, a 45-year-old man visited our hospital with a penile urethral avulsion injury. A penoplasty with the goal of penile augmentation had previously been performed in a private clinic. A proximal penile urethral injury was found after the surgery. At the first visit, the patient had normal vital signs, and on physical examination, the caliber of the 1 cm urethra was observed to be reduced by about half in the proximal penile urethra. The blood tests showed a hemoglobin value of 14.2 g/dL and a serum creatinine of 0.93 mg/dL. The results of urine analysis were normal and a culture of the urine was negative. The surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia with the patient in the lithotomy position. First, a 1 cm skin island was drawn for Island-patch urethroplasty in the center and midline of the biaxial flap (). The whole injured urethra was exposed on the ventral face, and the edges were sutured with the island patch with the use of 5-zero absorbable interrupted sutures.\nThere were no complications, and no abnormal blood test results were noted after the surgery. A 16 Fr Foley catheter was kept in place for 2 weeks, and a voiding cystogram performed 2 weeks after the surgery showed no leaking of contrast media around the urethra. The patient returned home after removal of the Foley catheter, and he has experienced no lower urinary tract symptoms for 6 months.","{'visit motivation': 'With a cystostomy tube', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Wonkwang University School of Medicine and Hospital'}], 'patient information': {'age': '62', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'Mongolian', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'TURP 3 years previously for benign prostatic hyperplasia, developed a proximal penile urethral stricture after the previous TURP', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Proximal penile urethral stricture', 'Type': 'Tubular urethroplasty', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'No complications, no abnormal blood test results after the surgery', 'details': 'A rectangular 3 cm sized flap was drawn on the stretched skin of the posterior scrotal face, centered over the mid raphe.

A 62-year-old man from Mongolia visited Wonkwang University School of Medicine and Hospital with a cystostomy tube. His past medical history included a TURP 3 years previously for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A proximal penile urethral stricture had developed after the previous TURP. At the first visit, the patient had normal vital signs, and his blood tests showed a hemoglobin value of 13.0 g/dL and serum creatinine of 0.80 mg/dL. The results of a urine analysis were normal, and the results of urine culture tests were negative. A retrograde urethrogram showed an approximately 2 cm sized stricture in the proximal penile urethra ().\nThe surgery was performed with the patient under spinal anesthesia in the lithotomy position. First, a rectangular 3 cm sized flap was drawn on the stretched skin of the posterior scrotal face, centered over the mid raphe, for tubular urethroplasty (A). The skin strip was tubularized on a 16 Fr catheter with 5-zero absorbable continuous polyglycolic acid sutures and the avoidance of skin eversion. A second plane was made by suturing above the outer edges of the flap with interrupted polyglycolic acid sutures, and the tube was formed by a thick musculocutaneous wall (). Following segmental urethrectomy (), the tubularized flap was interposed by rotating it 135 degrees on its perineal scrotal base, which inverted its 2 ends. Proximal and distal anastomoses with the healthy urethra were performed with 5-zero absorbable interrupted sutures ().\nThere were no complications, and no abnormal blood test results were noted after the surgery. A 16 Fr Foley catheter was kept in place for 2 weeks, and a voiding cystogram performed 2 weeks after the surgery showed no leaking of contrast media around the urethra (). The patient returned home after removal of the Foley catheter and experienced subsequent symptoms of an overactive bladder for which he was prescribed anticholinergics.\nIn the second case, a 45-year-old man visited our hospital with a penile urethral avulsion injury. A penoplasty with the goal of penile augmentation had previously been performed in a private clinic. A proximal penile urethral injury was found after the surgery. At the first visit, the patient had normal vital signs, and on physical examination, the caliber of the 1 cm urethra was observed to be reduced by about half in the proximal penile urethra. The blood tests showed a hemoglobin value of 14.2 g/dL and a serum creatinine of 0.93 mg/dL. The results of urine analysis were normal and a culture of the urine was negative. The surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia with the patient in the lithotomy position. First, a 1 cm skin island was drawn for Island-patch urethroplasty in the center and midline of the biaxial flap (). The whole injured urethra was exposed on the ventral face, and the edges were sutured with the island patch with the use of 5-zero absorbable interrupted sutures.\nThere were no complications, and no abnormal blood test results were noted after the surgery. A 16 Fr Foley catheter was kept in place for 2 weeks, and a voiding cystogram performed 2 weeks after the surgery showed no leaking of contrast media around the urethra. The patient returned home after removal of the Foley catheter, and he has experienced no lower urinary tract symptoms for 6 months.

200299,"A 72-year-old man with a history of anteroseptal acute myocardial infarction was admitted to our hospital with acute heart failure. He underwent left ventricular (LV) reconstruction due to LV aneurysm, coronary artery bypass grafting from the left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior descending artery, mitral valvuloplasty with artificial ring for moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid valvuloplasty with artificial ring 18 months earlier. On admission, his blood pressure was 86/55 mmHg, heart rate was 60 b.p.m., and a visible apex beat was present at the 6th left intercostal space just medial to the left mid-clavicular line (, Video S1). Computed tomography revealed a pseudoaneurysm with mild calcification, protruding outside the thorax around the apex of the heart (Figure ). Echocardiogram showed akinesis of the anteroseptal wall and a 40 × 27-mm pseudoaneurysm around the apex of the heart, moving in synchrony with the heartbeat, and a 17% LV ejection fraction (Figure , , Video S2). The connection was confirmed between the pseudoaneurysm and the left ventricle with a spontaneous echo contrast. An underlying infection could have contributed to the formation of the pseudoaneurysm. We theorize that as the pseudoaneurysm progressed, the tissue along its path of progression was mechanically damaged. This gradual damage could have resulted in impaired structural integrity of the surrounding tissue which ultimately allowed certain segments of the heart to protrude into regions beyond the normal anatomical confines of the heart. Left ventricular ejection fraction slightly improved from 17% to 25%, before and after the operation, respectively. The patient was discharged after a protracted hospital course. After discharge, the patient is now coming for follow-ups at regular intervals. Most LV pseudoaneurysm patients present with various clinical observations and abnormal findings on physical examination, such as heart failure, dyspnoea, and chest pain; however, 10% of patients are asymptomatic. In the present case, the pseudoaneurysm protruded into the left thoracic cavity with the pericardium and perforated subcutaneously from the intercostal space.

73091,"A 25 year old G2P1001 sub-Saharan African married seamstress at 8 weeks amenorrhea, presented to a primary level hospital in Cameroon with 4 days history of lower abdominal pains and vaginal bleeding. She had no known chronic illness and denied having any past history of pelvic inflammatory disease or assisted reproduction.\nShe reported being well till 4 days prior to presentation when she started experiencing abdominal pain; the pain was mainly in her lower abdomen, dull in nature, non-radiating, mild in intensity and was initially intermittent then became constant. It was associated with mild per vagina loss of bright red blood. She had no other symptoms. This prompted her to consult at a drug store, where she was prescribed phloroglucinol tablets 80 mg/day in 2 divided doses which she took for 3 days but had no regression of the symptoms. The persistent lower abdominal pain and mild vagina bleeding prompted a second consultation at our health facility. Upon presentation she was haemodynamically stable and vaginal examination was relevant for a closed cervix. A presumptive diagnosis of threatened abortion with possible aetiology of a urinary tract infection was made. Urinalysis showed leucocyturia while obstetric echography revealed an empty gestational sac measuring 29.9 mm. Diagnoses of blighted ovum and urinary tract infection were made. She was given a short course of antibiotics and programmed for manual vacuum aspiration. Vacuum aspiration was done and the patient served a single intramuscular dose of 10 units of oxytocin. The bleeding and lower abdominal pain stopped and she was discharged the next day.\nTwo weeks following discharge lower abdominal pain reoccurred. This time, the abdominal pain was constant and localized to the left lower quadrant. It was associated with intermittent episodes of bright red vaginal bleeding. These symptoms persisted for 3 days and prompted another consultation.\nOn arrival she had a good general state. Her blood pressure was 102/64 mmHg, heart rate 88 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, temperature 37.2 °C, O2 saturation at 97% and weight 58 kg. Her conjunctivae were pink and no scleral icterus, heart sounds were normal and lung fields clear. Her abdomen was flat, moved with respiration and there were no scars. There was no tenderness on superficial palpation but left iliac fossa tenderness on deep palpation. The liver and spleen were not palpable. A speculum examination was unremarkable but for bright red blood oozing out of the cervical os. Vaginal examination revealed a firm closed posterior cervix with left adnexal tenderness on bimanual palpation. The limbs were without particularity.\nBased on these findings a tentative diagnosis of an associated ectopic pregnancy was made. A repeat pelvic ultrasound revealed: a homogenous uterus; left adnexal mass measuring 58 mls; pouch of Douglass collection. A repeat positive pregnancy test and sonographic findings confirmed a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.\nThe patient was immediately planned for an emergency exploratory laparotomy indicated for a possible ectopic pregnancy. Preoperative work up included: normal haemoglobin of 11.7 g/dl; normal white cell count of 8100/µl; normal platelet count of 320,000/µl, normal kidney function test (serum creatinine of 0.64 mg/dl and urea of 12.7 mg/dl), glycaemia of 85.9 mg/dl and normal serum electrolytes of: (sodium 134 mmol/l, potassium of 4.17 mmol/l and chloride of 103 mmol/l).\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia. Intra-operative findings revealed unruptured left tubal pregnancy (Fig. ) in the ampulla. A left salpingectomy was performed with excision of the unruptured fetus. The right tube was inspected and found to be normal. The abdomen was then closed layer by layer. The patient was monitored in the recovery room for 1 h during which she was haemodynamically stable. She was sent to the ward where close monitoring continued.\nPostoperatively, the patient was maintained on nil per os, intravenous infusions of dextrose–saline, intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and analgaesics. Early ambulation was encouraged upon recovery from general anaesthesia. Routine postoperative care in the ward continued and was uneventful. She was discharged on post operation day 7. Evolution thereafter was favourable.","{'visit motivation': 'Lower abdominal pains and vaginal bleeding', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Threatened abortion with possible aetiology of a urinary tract infection', 'date': 'None', 'duration': '1 day', 'care center details': 'Primary level hospital in Cameroon'}], 'patient information': {'age': '25 years old', 'sex': 'None', 'ethnicity': 'Sub-Saharan African', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'Married seamstress', 'occupation': 'Seamstress'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'G2P1001 at 8 weeks amenorrhea', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Blighted ovum', 'Type': 'Manual vacuum aspiration', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Bleeding and lower abdominal pain stopped', 'details': 'Patient served a single intramuscular dose of 10 units of oxytocin'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Lower abdominal pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'Mild in intensity', 'location': 'Lower abdomen', 'time': 'Started 4 days prior to first presentation, reoccurred two weeks following discharge', 'temporalisation': 'Initially intermittent then became constant', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Dull in nature, non-radiating, associated with vaginal bleeding'}, {'name of symptom': 'Vaginal bleeding', 'intensity of symptom': 'Mild', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'Started 4 days prior to first presentation, intermittent episodes after discharge', 'temporalisation': 'Intermittent episodes', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Per vagina loss of bright red blood'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Vaginal examination', 'result': 'Closed cervix', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Urinalysis', 'result': 'Leucocyturia', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Obstetric echography', 'result': 'Empty gestational sac measuring 29.9 mm', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Obstetric echography', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Empty gestational sac measuring 29.9 mm', 'condition': 'Blighted ovum', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Urinalysis', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Leucocyturia', 'condition': 'Urinary tract infection', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Phloroglucinol tablets', 'related condition': 'Lower abdominal pain', 'dosage': '80 mg/day', 'time': 'Taken for 3 days prior to first hospital visit', 'frequency': 'In 2 divided doses', 'duration': '3 days', 'reason for taking': 'To alleviate abdominal pain', 'reaction to treatment': 'No regression of the symptoms', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Antibiotics', 'related condition': 'Urinary tract infection', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Prescribed upon first hospital visit', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'Short course', 'reason for taking': 'To treat urinary tract infection', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Oxytocin', 'related condition': 'Post-manual vacuum aspiration', 'dosage': 'Single intramuscular dose of 10 units', 'time': 'Administered after manual vacuum aspiration', 'frequency': 'Single dose', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To stop bleeding and lower abdominal pain', 'reaction to treatment': 'Bleeding and lower abdominal pain stopped', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'Resolution of symptoms', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'Patient was discharged the next day after vacuum aspiration and administration of oxytocin'}}","[['When was the treatment initiated?', 'How often was the medication or treatment administered?', 'Why was this treatment initiated?', 'What specific condition was the treatment intended to address?', 'How long did the patient receive the treatment?', 'What medication or treatment was administered?', 'What was the dosage of the medication or treatment?', 'Did the patient experience any side effects or reactions to the treatment?', 'Are there any additional details mentioned about the treatment (e.g., route of administration, specific instructions)?'], ['What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?']]",Treatments,Medical Examinations,"

A 25 year old G2P1001 sub-Saharan African married seamstress at 8 weeks amenorrhea, presented to a primary level hospital in Cameroon with 4 days history of lower abdominal pains and vaginal bleeding. She had no known chronic illness and denied having any past history of pelvic inflammatory disease or assisted reproduction.\nShe reported being well till 4 days prior to presentation when she started experiencing abdominal pain; the pain was mainly in her lower abdomen, dull in nature, non-radiating, mild in intensity and was initially intermittent then became constant. It was associated with mild per vagina loss of bright red blood. She had no other symptoms. This prompted her to consult at a drug store, where she was prescribed phloroglucinol tablets 80 mg/day in 2 divided doses which she took for 3 days but had no regression of the symptoms. The persistent lower abdominal pain and mild vagina bleeding prompted a second consultation at our health facility. Upon presentation she was haemodynamically stable and vaginal examination was relevant for a closed cervix. A presumptive diagnosis of threatened abortion with possible aetiology of a urinary tract infection was made. Urinalysis showed leucocyturia while obstetric echography revealed an empty gestational sac measuring 29.9 mm. Diagnoses of blighted ovum and urinary tract infection were made. She was given a short course of antibiotics and programmed for manual vacuum aspiration. Vacuum aspiration was done and the patient served a single intramuscular dose of 10 units of oxytocin. The bleeding and lower abdominal pain stopped and she was discharged the next day.\nTwo weeks following discharge lower abdominal pain reoccurred. This time, the abdominal pain was constant and localized to the left lower quadrant. It was associated with intermittent episodes of bright red vaginal bleeding. These symptoms persisted for 3 days and prompted another consultation.\nOn arrival she had a good general state. Her blood pressure was 102/64 mmHg, heart rate 88 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, temperature 37.2 °C, O2 saturation at 97% and weight 58 kg. Her conjunctivae were pink and no scleral icterus, heart sounds were normal and lung fields clear. Her abdomen was flat, moved with respiration and there were no scars. There was no tenderness on superficial palpation but left iliac fossa tenderness on deep palpation. The liver and spleen were not palpable. A speculum examination was unremarkable but for bright red blood oozing out of the cervical os. Vaginal examination revealed a firm closed posterior cervix with left adnexal tenderness on bimanual palpation. The limbs were without particularity.\nBased on these findings a tentative diagnosis of an associated ectopic pregnancy was made. A repeat pelvic ultrasound revealed: a homogenous uterus; left adnexal mass measuring 58 mls; pouch of Douglass collection. A repeat positive pregnancy test and sonographic findings confirmed a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.\nThe patient was immediately planned for an emergency exploratory laparotomy indicated for a possible ectopic pregnancy. Preoperative work up included: normal haemoglobin of 11.7 g/dl; normal white cell count of 8100/µl; normal platelet count of 320,000/µl, normal kidney function test (serum creatinine of 0.64 mg/dl and urea of 12.7 mg/dl), glycaemia of 85.9 mg/dl and normal serum electrolytes of: (sodium 134 mmol/l, potassium of 4.17 mmol/l and chloride of 103 mmol/l).\nAn emergency laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia. Intra-operative findings revealed unruptured left tubal pregnancy (Fig. ) in the ampulla. A left salpingectomy was performed with excision of the unruptured fetus. The right tube was inspected and found to be normal. The abdomen was then closed layer by layer. The patient was monitored in the recovery room for 1 h during which she was haemodynamically stable. She was sent to the ward where close monitoring continued.\nPostoperatively, the patient was maintained on nil per os, intravenous infusions of dextrose–saline, intravenous prophylactic antibiotics and analgaesics. Early ambulation was encouraged upon recovery from general anaesthesia. Routine postoperative care in the ward continued and was uneventful. She was discharged on post operation day 7. Evolution thereafter was favourable.

7693,"A 51-year-old female patient presented to our orthopedic outpatient department with a rapidly enlarging ulcerated right upper arm swelling which was growing gradually over the past six months. She recalled that it had been a pea-sized lesion and had remained the same size over the past 30 years. No history of preceding episodes of trauma or local irritation was found. The initially asymptomatic lesion had recently become painful and pruritic with slight bleeding. On examination, a large nodulo-ulcerative plaque was noted on the right upper arm, measuring approximately 12 cm × 6 cm in size (). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass measuring 12 cm × 6 cm × 1.5 cm, invading the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles (). Examination of the needle biopsy specimen demonstrated the proliferation of spindle cells in a storiform arrangement in the dermis. Results of tests for CD34 and factor VIII were negative, suggesting the possibility of a benign tumor. However, the clinical findings, which included muscle invasion, large tumor size, and rapid enlargement, suggested the possibility of malignancy, prompting the need for wide resection and myocutaneous flap-plasty. Intraoperatively, the tumor was found to have invaded the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles, as well as the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Wide resection was achieved with a 3 cm margin. A latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was needed to close the skin defect. The postoperative period was uneventful. Histopathological examination following hematoxylin and eosin stain revealed spindle cell proliferation with a vague storiform growth pattern and basal cell hyperplasia in the overlying epidermal cells (). The tumor tested negative for CD 34 on immunohistochemical staining but tested positive for SMA, CD 68, and factor XIIIa (Figures –). Mitoses were inconspicuous in the lesion, and the Ki 67 labeling index was also low, at 1 to 2%. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of dermatofibroma. In 5 years of follow-up, the patient did not experience any recurrence, metastases, or other complications.","{'visit motivation': 'Rapidly enlarging ulcerated right upper arm swelling', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Rapidly enlarging ulcerated right upper arm swelling', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Orthopedic outpatient department'}], 'patient information': {'age': '51', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Pea-sized lesion on right upper arm present for 30 years', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Tumor with possibility of malignancy', 'Type': 'Wide resection and myocutaneous flap-plasty', 'time': 'Intraoperative', 'outcome': 'Unspecified', 'details': 'Tumor invaded deltoid and triceps brachii muscles, wide resection achieved with a 3 cm margin, latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap used to close skin defect'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Swelling', 'intensity of symptom': 'Rapidly enlarging', 'location': 'Right upper arm', 'time': 'Over the past six months', 'temporalisation': 'Initially asymptomatic, recently became painful and pruritic with slight bleeding', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Initially a pea-sized lesion, remained the same size over the past 30 years'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Large nodulo-ulcerative plaque', 'details': 'Measuring approximately 12 cm × 6 cm'}, {'name': 'MRI', 'result': 'Mass', 'details': 'Measuring 12 cm × 6 cm × 1.5 cm, invading the deltoid and triceps brachii muscles'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Needle biopsy', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Proliferation of spindle cells in a storiform arrangement in the dermis', 'condition': 'Benign tumor suggested, possibility of malignancy due to clinical findings', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Negative for CD34 and factor VIII'}, {'test': 'Histopathological examination', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Spindle cell proliferation with a vague storiform growth pattern and basal cell hyperplasia in the overlying epidermal cells', 'condition': 'Dermatofibroma', 'time': 'Postoperative', 'details': 'Negative for CD 34, positive for SMA, CD 68, and factor XIIIa, low Ki 67 labeling index at 1 to 2%'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Wide resection and myocutaneous flap-plasty', 'related condition': 'Tumor with possibility of malignancy', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Intraoperative', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Muscle invasion, large tumor size, and rapid enlargement', 'reaction to treatment': 'Unspecified', 'details': 'Wide resection achieved with a 3 cm margin, latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap used to close skin defect'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'Unspecified', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': '5 years of follow-up', 'discharge summary': 'Postoperative period was uneventful'}}","[['When was the surgery performed?', 'What was the reason for the surgery?', 'What type of surgery was performed?', 'What was the outcome of the surgery (e.g., successful, complications)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the surgical procedure or complications?'], ['What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?']]",Surgeries,Medical Examinations,"

Subsequently, he was started on intravenous decadron.\nThe patient was discussed at the brain tumor board, where the plan was to address the aneurysm followed by resection of the mass versus close monitoring with subsequent imaging. The high risk of rehemorrhage, given the possibility of an aneurysmal hemorrhage, motivated prompt treatment of the aneurysm. The patient was taken to the angiography suite. An anterosuperiorly projecting azygous A2 aneurysm, measuring 4.5 mm × 5.5 mm with a neck width at 3.5 mm and a small daughter sac, was completely obliterated with primary coiling (). Visualization of the external carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries bilaterally did not show any tumor blush. The following day, he underwent a left craniotomy along a forehead skin crease for mass excision. Final pathology revealed glioblastoma. The patient recovered well from both procedures, with a baseline neurological exam. The patient subsequently underwent hypofractionated radiation and temodar. The Medical College of Wisconsin does not require Institutional Review Board approval or patient consent for this case study.

158698,"A 12-year-old male patient visited the outpatient department with chief complaint of an oversized protruded tooth in the maxillary right anterior teeth region. The patient reported that no other individual in the family had this type of anomaly and there were no anomalies found in the deciduous dentition or any history of trauma. General examination of the patient did not reveal any other associated abnormalities. Intraoral examination revealed the presence of mixed dentition stage. The tooth number 11 had a wide crown and showed the presence of a notch on the incisal edge along with prominent mamelons []. The macrodontic incisor measured 15 mm mesiodistally at the midcoronal level and 8.5 mm cervicoincisally. Lingual examination revealed an accessory cusp-like structure, resembling a talon cusp extending from cervical margin of 11 towards its incisal edge measuring 5.5 mm cervicoincisally. Non carious developmental grooves were present at the junction of the talon cusp and the palatal surface of the tooth []. The maxillary central incisor on the contralateral side appeared normal in dimensions but was in crossbite with mandibular left central incisor []. The maxillary lateral incisor on the affected side had erupted palatally []. The number of teeth remained unaffected in the segment. Mandibular anterior segment also revealed marked crowding. The affected tooth responded normally to pulp vitality test. Intraoral periapical radiograph revealed the presence of a large anomalous tooth, which was superimposed by lateral incisor palatally []. The maxillary lateral incisor on the affected side was extracted as part of the treatment plan. The intraoral periapical radiograph then revealed two roots with individual pulp canals.

13861,"Our case is a 24-year-old primigravida woman. She conceived spontaneously and her due date was confirmed by crown-rump length measurements in the first trimester. At 18 weeks of gestation, there were no signs of a low-lying placenta or placenta previa. At 24 weeks of gestation, she complained of vaginal bleeding and came to the clinic for a consultation. On examination, the patient was found to have slight intermittent bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed signs of vasa previa, and she was referred to our perinatal center. On ultrasonography, the placenta was seen to be on the anterior wall and there were no signs of placental malposition. The presence of vasa previa as well as velamentous umbilical cord insertion was confirmed by transvaginal ultrasonography, which demonstrated the cord vessels running on the anterior lower uterine segment and covering the internal cervical os (Figure ). The vaginal bleeding ceased on examination, and it was found to be unrelated to the vasa previa. There was no fetal distress detected on fetal heart monitoring. She was hospitalized from 32 weeks and 5 days of gestation. At 33 weeks of gestation, the normal placental position as well as the absence of abnormal placental morphology was confirmed by an MRI scan (Figure ). In addition, MRI confirmed the precise course of the cord vessels running on the anterior lower segment of the uterus (Figure ). We performed a cesarean section at 35 weeks and 1 day of gestation. Because the cord vessels were running on the anterior lower uterine segment, the horizontal incision was made on the uterine fundus to avoid the rupture of the cord vessels.

18519,"A 27-year-old female patient presented with an indolent but progressive swelling of the right mid femur over the last 2–3 months in our outpatient consultation hour of our university hospital. She reported of a known osteogenisis imperfecta type V, being the only member of her family suffering from it. Clinical phenotype was characterized by short statue, a mild kypho-scoliosis, a short neck and a mild ligamentous hyperlaxity. She did not report of a trauma or any inflammatory disease. Although numerous fractures of the lower extremities occurred over the last decade which were treated conservatively as well as operatively by intramedullary nailing, HPC or extraordinary swelling never developed.\nConventional radiographs of the affected area showed a massive osseous tumor of the right femoral mid-shaft (). Radiographically the lesion was characterized by a massive irregular hypertrophic lamellar ossification with an irregular sunburst pattern as well as the appearance of spiculae, showing potential periosteal signs of malignancy. Laboratory tests only showed an elevated level of alkaline phosphatase of 257 U/l.\nIn the assumption of a malignant osteosarcoma, further tumor staging was initiated, including contrasted computed tomography of thorax, abdomen and pelvis.

170618,"A previously healthy 6-year-old boy presented to a pediatric hospital with a 3-week history of torticollis. He had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection four weeks prior and had 2 days of documented fever at home during that time. He had been treated with a 7-day course of amoxicillin by the primary care physician for suspected streptococcal pharyngitis. Four days into the course of antibiotics, he woke up from sleep with pain on the left side of his neck. Despite taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen, he presented to the Emergency Department 3 weeks later due to persisting torticollis. Pain was worse with movement. There was no history of head/neck trauma. At the time of presentation, the infectious symptoms had resolved. Some fatigue was noted but he remained generally active, continuing to play hockey. There was no history of rash, peripheral joint pain, or weight loss. Past medical history and family history were unremarkable.\nOn examination, the patient was afebrile with normal blood pressure for age and a maximum heart rate of 110 beats per minute. The patient's head was tilted to the right with chin rotation to the left. No lymphadenopathy or masses were noted on palpation of the neck. There was no tenderness to palpation of bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles. There was a limited range of motion in all planes of rotation of the neck secondary to pain, particularly in lateral flexion. Bilateral injected conjunctivas were present. The oropharynx was normal with no erythema or mucus membrane changes. Cardiovascular exam revealed normal peripheral pulses, a quiet precordium with normal heart sounds, and no murmur. Respiratory exam was normal. The abdomen was soft with no distension, tenderness, or hepatosplenomegaly. There were no bruits heard on auscultation of major vessel regions. There were no rashes or desquamation of the skin. Neurological exam was normal.\nAt the time of presentation, laboratory investigations revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 17.4 × 109/L with a neutrophil count of 14.1 × 109/L. Hemoglobin was normal for age at 110 g/L. Inflammatory markers were elevated including platelet count of 860 × 109/L and CRP of 38.5 mg/L. Renal function (BUN and creatinine) and liver function (ALP and ALT) were normal for age. Because of the unexplained elevated white blood cell count and evidence of inflammation, a chest X-ray was performed which revealed normal lung fields but an enlarged cardiac silhouette. X-ray of the cervical spine was normal with no atlantoaxial rotary subluxation demonstrated. Ultrasound of the neck revealed mild thickening of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle and no lymphadenopathy. Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler was normal.\nAdditional investigations included a normal throat swab for group A streptococci and a negative anti-streptolysin O antibody titer. High-sensitivity troponin was elevated to 176 ng/L. Creatinine kinase was normal. ANCA was normal. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythms without evidence of chamber hypertrophy. The patient underwent an echocardiogram to further characterize the enlarged cardiac silhouette identified on the chest X-ray. This revealed massive ectasia and aneurysmal dilatation of the right coronary artery, left main artery, left anterior descending artery, and circumflex arteries, as seen in . Left ventricular function was normal. The aortic arch was normal as were the proximal neck vessels.\nBecause of the dilated coronary aneurysms, the patient was diagnosed with KD. Despite lack of fever, given the evidence of ongoing inflammation and initial presence of bilateral nonsuppurative conjunctivitis, in addition to the coronary artery changes, the patient was treated with high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) and started on daily low-dose aspirin. Low-molecular-weight heparin was started as antithrombotic therapy and once stabilized, daily atenolol was initiated. Activity was restricted as much as possible.\nInflammatory markers were followed. Platelets revealed a peak of 952 × 109/L and CRP a peak of 54.6 mg/L. After treatment, both platelet and CRP levels normalized.\nThe patient's neck pain and the limited range of movement resolved immediately after treatment, as did the bilateral conjunctivitis. The patient was stable and appeared well at time of discharge. His aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and atenolol were continued. The CT angiogram performed after discharge revealed massively dilated and aneurysmal coronary arteries, as shown in .\nIn follow-up cardiology and rheumatology clinics, he has been doing well with no further neck pain or stiffness. He did not develop desquamation during follow-up, and the repeat echocardiogram one month after discharge was unchanged. He will continue long-term anticoagulation therapy with low-dose heparin with a target level greater than 0.5 IU/ml. He will also continue low dose aspirin and atenolol. His family was advised to have the annual influenza vaccine.","{'visit motivation': 'Persisting torticollis', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Persisting torticollis and pain with movement', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Pediatric hospital'}], 'patient information': {'age': '6-year-old', 'sex': 'boy', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'Unremarkable', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Previously healthy', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'Remained generally active, continuing to play hockey', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Torticollis', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Neck', 'time': '3-week history', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Pain worse with movement', 'details': 'Started four days into the course of antibiotics'}, {'name of symptom': 'Pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Left side of neck', 'time': 'Woke up from sleep with pain', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Pain worse with movement', 'details': 'Despite taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen'}, {'name of symptom': 'Fatigue', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'At the time of presentation', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Some fatigue was noted but he remained generally active'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Normal', 'details': 'Head tilted to the right with chin rotation to the left, no lymphadenopathy or masses, no tenderness of bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles, limited range of motion in neck, bilateral injected conjunctivas, normal oropharynx, normal cardiovascular and respiratory exams, soft abdomen with no distension, tenderness, or hepatosplenomegaly, no bruits, no rashes or desquamation, normal neurological exam'}], 'diagnosis tests': [], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Amoxicillin', 'related condition': 'Suspected streptococcal pharyngitis', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Started four weeks prior', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': '7-day course', 'reason for taking': 'Treatment by the primary care physician', 'reaction to treatment': 'Torticollis symptoms started four days into the course', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Ibuprofen and acetaminophen', 'related condition': 'Pain on the left side of neck', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To alleviate neck pain', 'reaction to treatment': 'Presented to the Emergency Department 3 weeks later due to persisting torticollis', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Does the note mention any drug usage?', 'Does the patient have any allergies to medications or other substances?', 'Does the note mention any relevant psychological conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression)?', ""Does the note mention the patient's exercise habits?"", ""Does the note mention the patient's alcohol consumption habits (e.g., frequency, amount)?"", 'Does the note mention any dietary restrictions or concerns (e.g., allergies, weight management)?', ""Does the note mention any recent vaccinations or the patient's immunization status?"", ""Does the note mention the patient's smoking history?

96263,"A 57-year-old man was informed regarding a possible diagnosis of gastric cancer at a local clinic on November 15, 2016, based on the results of endoscopic examination previously performed following his complaints of weight loss, abdominal pain, and indigestion. On the same day, the patient visited the department of gastroenterology at a university hospital for endoscopy including biopsy. The tests revealed advanced gastric cancer in the distal antrum (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans subsequently confirmed the presence of cancer and metastasis. The results showed invasion of the entire wall of the antrum with regional lymph node metastasis (). He was diagnosed with stage IIIB gastric cancer (T4N2M0). On December 6, 2016, the patient underwent subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth I anastomosis and cholecystectomy, and was started on chemotherapy. Despite the treatment, he died of gastric cancer on January 9, 2018. Apart from having received treatment for chronic hepatitis B, the patient had never been diagnosed with any disease of the GI tract prior to the gastric cancer diagnosis. During the endoscopy performed on November 15, 2016, he was not tested for H. pylori infection; in addition, he never underwent any tests for H. pylori infection. We were thus unable to determine the presence of H. pylori infection. He had a 1–10 pack-years history of smoking, did not drink, and had no particular relevant family medical history. At the time of his job history survey, the patient was working as a day laborer; his official job history could not therefore be established. We accordingly reviewed his employment insurance records, the National Tax Service (NTS) reports, and his own statements. Based on the combined information, we summarized that the patient had worked as an oxygen cutter at shipbreaking workplaces from 1978 to the 1990s (for approximately 17 years). Furthermore, during the 1990s and 2010s (until 2016), he worked for 7 years at building demolition workplaces as a member of the boiler dismantling crew, and also spent another 14 years in dismantling factories and various thermal power generation plants. Altogether, the patient had presumably worked for about 40 years since 1978 as an oxygen cutter at workplaces that dismantle ships, buildings, boilers, and thermal power plants.","{'visit motivation': 'Possible diagnosis of gastric cancer', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Endoscopy including biopsy', 'date': 'November 15, 2016', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Department of gastroenterology at a university hospital'}], 'patient information': {'age': '57', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'No particular relevant family medical history', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'Day laborer, oxygen cutter at shipbreaking workplaces from 1978 to the 1990s, building demolition workplaces during the 1990s and 2010s until 2016'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Chronic hepatitis B', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'Did not drink', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': '1–10 pack-years history of smoking'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Advanced gastric cancer in the distal antrum with regional lymph node metastasis', 'Type': 'Subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth I anastomosis and cholecystectomy', 'time': 'December 6, 2016', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Weight loss, abdominal pain, indigestion', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Abdomen', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Endoscopic examination', 'result': 'Advanced gastric cancer in the distal antrum', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans', 'result': 'Confirmed the presence of cancer and metastasis', 'details': 'Invasion of the entire wall of the antrum with regional lymph node metastasis'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Endoscopy including biopsy', 'severity': 'Stage IIIB', 'result': 'Advanced gastric cancer (T4N2M0)', 'condition': 'Gastric cancer', 'time': 'November 15, 2016', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Chemotherapy', 'related condition': 'Gastric cancer', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'After surgery on December 6, 2016', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Treatment for gastric cancer', 'reaction to treatment': 'Despite the treatment, he died of gastric cancer on January 9, 2018', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'Death', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'Patient died of gastric cancer on January 9, 2018'}}","[['When was the test performed?', 'What diagnostic test(s) were performed?', 'What were the results of the test (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What medical condition was the test intended to diagnose or investigate?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the test results (e.g., specific values, interpretations)?', 'Does the note indicate the severity of the condition based on the test results?'], ['What was the outcome of the surgery (e.g., successful, complications)?', 'What was the reason for the surgery?', 'When was the surgery performed?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the surgical procedure or complications?', 'What type of surgery was performed?']]",Diagnosis Tests,Surgeries,"

27245,"The patient was a 28-year-old Japanese woman, weighing 52 kg, with a right benign breast tumor. She had no history of neurological or psychiatric disease. The preoperative assessment was unremarkable. There seemed to be no history of neglect in her childhood or familial problems. She graduated from high school and was working for a company without any problems. The scheduled operation of her benign breast tumor was postponed for almost 2 months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, she seemed to be very nervous and anxious about her disease. She underwent an excision of the breast tumor under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with 150 mg of propofol, 100 mcg of fentanyl, and 50 mg of rocuronium. A #3 laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted in the first attempt. Sevoflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. Hemodynamic stability was maintained with only one dose of 4 mg of ephedrine. No local anesthetic agent was used during the procedure. Other intravenous medications administered intraoperatively were 100 mg of cefazolin and 6 mg of dexamethasone. For analgesia, 1000 mg of acetaminophen was administered. After the 1-h procedure, 200 mg of sugammadex was administered as a reversal agent after the recovery of spontaneous breathing. She demonstrated almost 450 mL of tidal volume, 10 times the respiratory rate per minute, and 0.2% of the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane before the removal of the LMA.\nIn the operating room, 5 min after removal of the LMA, she was able to open her eyes voluntarily and open her mouth and put her tongue out when we indicated. She was alert and oriented, with normal vital signs. However, complete paralysis of bilateral lower extremities and incomplete paralysis of bilateral upper extremities were noted. Additionally, 200 mg sugammadex was administered. The train-of-four (TOF) ratio was 1.0 in the posterior tibial nerve and 0.92 in the ulnar nerve 10 min after the additional administration of sugammadex. She began to move her upper extremity but not the lower extremity. Laboratory tests, including the blood chemistry test, full blood count, electrolytes, and blood gas, were unremarkable.\nUrgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine was performed to exclude intracranial and spinal complications. It showed no structural abnormalities that would require emergent treatment. The neurology team was immediately consulted for further evaluation. A neurologist conducted neurological examinations 2 h after the removal of the LMA. The patient could maintain bilateral knee positions with passive flexion of her knee by the neurologist, while she could not flex her knee actively. Loss of sensation was not observed in any lesions. There was no hyperreflexia or hypotonia. These immediate results of her physical examination were inconsistent with the MRI findings. Ultimately, she was suspected to have a conversion disorder after other neurologic diseases were excluded. After a 12-h observation, she fully recovered and she could walk without any assistance and was discharged. At the 10-day follow-up, she demonstrated no neurological deficits.","{'visit motivation': 'Scheduled operation for benign breast tumor', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Excision of benign breast tumor', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '28', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'Japanese', 'weight': '52 kg', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'Working for a company'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Right benign breast tumor', 'psychological context': 'No history of neurological or psychiatric disease', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Benign breast tumor', 'Type': 'Excision of breast tumor', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Postoperative paralysis of bilateral lower extremities and incomplete paralysis of bilateral upper extremities', 'details': 'General anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium.

167538,"A 48-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, visited the internal medicine department at another hospital with a complaint of abdominal fullness and weight loss of 10kg during the last year. A huge abdominal mass was palpated, and she was referred to the gynecology department to search for a tumor of uterine origin. She was premenopausal and had no significant past medical history. Physical findings revealed a large elastic hard mass extending from the xiphoid to the pubic bone. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a huge tumor on the uterine corpus, and a number of dilated vessels were observed between the tumor and the myometrium. Therefore, the tumor was suspected to derive from the uterus. The tumor showed an uneven signal on T2-weighted sagittal section (), and the enhanced MRI study showed that the tumor edge but not the center was enhanced (). As such, necrosis was suspected to have occurred in the center of the tumor. Uterine sarcoma was primarily suspected due to the large size, degeneration, and necrosis on MRI imaging. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed no lymph node swelling or distant metastasis. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.6g/dl). We transfused 18 units of RCC before surgery. CT examination and ultrasonography on lower extremities indicated an absence of thrombosis. Preoperative serum levels of CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, and LDH were within normal limits. A biopsy of the endometrium was not collected as the sounding examination of the endometrium was unsuccessful due to a deviated uterine cervix. At this point, preoperatively, we suspected the tumor was a leiomyosarcoma or leiomyoma with degeneration.\nThe patient underwent laparotomy, where we identified a huge tumor occupying a space from the pelvis to the diaphragm. The tumor surface was smooth and hard with many dilated veins (). A massive tumor with a diameter of 30 cm was observed arising from the posterior uterine wall with a smooth contour and invaded the retroperitoneal cavity under the mesentery. The tumor was firmly adhered to both the mesentery and right ovary. There were no findings of extra-uterine dissemination. The intraoperative frozen section report for the uterine tumor was of degenerated myoma with no findings indicating malignancy. A total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and right salpingo-oophorectomy (RSO) were performed. The operation duration and blood loss were approximately 216 minutes and 1000 ml, respectively. The excised specimen weighed 7600 g.\nMacroscopic findings of the tumor revealed a well-circumscribed tumor showing extensive continuity with the posterior wall of the uterus, measuring 28 × 23 cm (). On the sliced surface of the tumor, an obvious heterogeneous pattern was recognized within the mixture of a whitish homogeneous area, suggesting benign uterine fibroids, and a vulnerable area, due to bleeding and necrosis ().\nFor the intraoperative frozen section, we examined three areas, namely, a white homogenous part, a necrotic part, and a cystic part, of which all were findings of a leiomyoma. In the permanent histological examination, 10 additional sections were collected from the tumor. The basic histological findings of all the sections were the same. The tumor was comprised of spindle-shaped cells, homologous to smooth muscle cells, which were arranged in bundles with areas of hyalinization, consistent with a degenerated leiomyoma. The tumor was mostly comprised of degenerated uterine leiomyoma. However, enlarged blood vessels were observed within an area of approximately 2 cm × several mm, and proliferation of atypical cells showing a fine meshwork microvascular structure was observed in the blood vessel cavity (). These atypical cells consisted of various contours, such as cubic, polygonal, and short spindle shape. The nucleus was circular with a high degree of vacuolar enlargement and pleomorphism. Abnormal mitotic figures were also interspersed (). A tumor derived from a blood vessel was thus considered, and malignancy was suggested by the presence of nuclear atypia and abnormal mitosis.\nImmunohistochemical analysis revealed the atypical tumor cells to be positive for ERG, CD31, and AE1/3 (Figures and ), partially positive for Factor VIII, and negative for α-SMA, desmin, H-caldesmon, EMA, CD34, and D2-40. From the above, the atypical tumor cells were of epithelial origin and the final diagnosis was epithelioid angiosarcoma arising in a degenerated uterine leiomyoma.\nThe efficacy of postoperative adjuvant therapy for angiosarcoma has not been demonstrated and there is currently no established chemotherapy regimen. In this case, because the atypical tumor was observed in the blood vessel cavity, we thought it could have been spread hematogenously throughout the body. Hence, we selected adjuvant chemotherapy rather than adjuvant radiotherapy. Six courses of combination adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel (150mg/m2), epirubicin (50mg/m2), and carboplatin (area under the curve = 4) were administered in the present case, following referral to previous reported cases. No recurrence has been observed 10 months after the primary surgery.","{'visit motivation': 'Complaint of abdominal fullness and weight loss of 10kg during the last year', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Huge abdominal mass palpated, referred for suspicion of a tumor of uterine origin', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Referred to the gynecology department'}], 'patient information': {'age': '48', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Gravida 1, para 1, premenopausal', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Huge tumor suspected to be leiomyosarcoma or leiomyoma with degeneration', 'Type': 'Laparotomy', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'Identified a huge tumor occupying space from the pelvis to the diaphragm, smooth and hard with many dilated veins, arising from the posterior uterine wall with a smooth contour and invaded the retroperitoneal cavity under the mesentery'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Abdominal fullness', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Abdomen', 'time': 'Last year', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Weight loss of 10kg during the last year'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Large elastic hard mass extending from the xiphoid to the pubic bone', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Huge tumor on the uterine corpus with uneven signal on T2-weighted sagittal section and suspected necrosis in the center', 'condition': 'Suspected uterine sarcoma', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Enhanced MRI study showed that the tumor edge but not the center was enhanced'}, {'test': 'Computed tomography (CT)', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'No lymph node swelling or distant metastasis', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Preoperative laboratory testing', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Anemia (hemoglobin level, 5.6g/dl)', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Preoperative serum levels of CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, and LDH were within normal limits'}, {'test': 'Ultrasonography', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Absence of thrombosis on lower extremities', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Blood transfusion', 'related condition': 'Anemia', 'dosage': '18 units of RCC', 'time': 'Before surgery', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To manage preoperative anemia', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Does the note indicate the severity of the condition based on the test results?', 'When was the test performed?', 'What medical condition was the test intended to diagnose or investigate?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the test results (e.g., specific values, interpretations)?', 'What were the results of the test (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What diagnostic test(s) were performed?'], ['Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?', 'What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?']]",Diagnosis Tests,Medical Examinations,"

60605,"A 63-year-old Caucasian male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of bilateral lower-extremity muscle weakness and paresthesia. The patient first noticed a tingling sensation and bilateral lower-extremity myalgias approximately two weeks prior to presentation beginning the morning after engaging in a vigorous snow shoveling session. He initially attributed the symptoms to his shoveling; however, he reported no traumatic events while shoveling and did not experience any symptoms immediately afterward. Over the next few days, the patient's symptoms began spreading to his back and upper extremities, yet he was unable to describe any specific pattern of spread. The patient initially saw his primary care physician who started him on gabapentin for his neuropathic symptoms and encouraged him to follow up with outpatient neurology. Due to extenuating circumstances regarding pandemic-associated restrictions, the patient was unable to secure an outpatient neurology appointment date for more than a month out, prompting him to visit the emergency room.\nUpon presentation, the patient reported occasional shock-like sensations in his fingertips, progressive difficulty with ambulation, and pain between his shoulder blades that had interfered with his ability to sleep. He was noted to have been very active leading up to his presentation and was unable to identify any precipitating factors for his illness aside from his shoveling. After extensive questioning for additional history, the patient reported a known COVID-19 exposure when his wife tested positive about four weeks prior to the onset of his current symptoms. He was never tested at that time but did experience fatigue, headaches, mild cough, and loss of taste. He completed a 14-day quarantine at home, and apart from the loss of taste, all his other symptoms had completely resolved. He saw no association between those symptoms and his current symptoms.\nOn examination, the patient was in no acute distress with no evidence of respiratory compromise. Muscle strength was 4/5 bilaterally in the lower extremities and 5/5 in the upper extremities. No sensory abnormalities were noted. Deep tendon reflexes were absent bilaterally in the lower extremities and 1+ in the upper extremities. Gait was grossly abnormal and unsteady. The physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. The patient denied any difficulty breathing or bladder/bowel incontinence. Vital signs were all within normal limits, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course. Initial laboratory workup was significant for an elevated creatinine kinase of 472 units/L. Results of a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lactate, vitamin B12 level, and C-reactive protein were otherwise within normal limits. Chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary process, and brain and complete spinal MRI results were notable for only mild lumbar spinal stenosis and age-related degenerative changes. Lumbar puncture was performed under fluoroscopic guidance, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed albuminocytologic dissociation (Table ).\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen despite the patient having no symptoms of active disease, which likely represented residual virus from infection during the previous month. The clinical picture and albuminocytologic dissociation in CSF analysis were at this point consistent with GBS, likely from the recent COVID-19 infection as no other possible etiologic causes could be identified. Electromyography analysis was inconclusive to distinguish between axonal loss and demyelination; however, findings were consistent with a diffuse, largely symmetrical sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy of moderate degree. A ""sural sparing"" pattern was identified in the left lower extremity, which can sometimes be seen in the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype of GBS (Table ) [].\nThe patient was started on a five-day course of 0.4 g/kg IVIG, as per neurology recommendations. He remained stable throughout treatment with excellent negative inspiratory forces. At the completion of treatment, he was medically cleared for a safe discharge to home, with recommendation to continue home physical therapy, and was instructed to follow up with neurology on an outpatient basis in 3-4 weeks.","{'visit motivation': 'Bilateral lower-extremity muscle weakness and paresthesia', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Inability to secure an outpatient neurology appointment and worsening symptoms', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '63', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'Caucasian', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'No significant past medical history', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'Very active leading up to presentation', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Bilateral lower-extremity muscle weakness', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Bilateral lower extremities', 'time': 'Noticed approximately two weeks prior to presentation', 'temporalisation': 'Progressive', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Vigorous snow shoveling session', 'details': 'Initially attributed symptoms to shoveling; no traumatic events while shoveling; symptoms began spreading to back and upper extremities'}, {'name of symptom': 'Paresthesia', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Bilateral lower extremities', 'time': 'Noticed approximately two weeks prior to presentation', 'temporalisation': 'Progressive', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Vigorous snow shoveling session', 'details': 'Tingling sensation and myalgias; spreading to back and upper extremities without specific pattern'}, {'name of symptom': 'Shock-like sensations', 'intensity of symptom': 'Occasional', 'location': 'Fingertips', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name of symptom': 'Difficulty with ambulation', 'intensity of symptom': 'Progressive', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Interfered with ability to sleep'}, {'name of symptom': 'Pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Between shoulder blades', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Interfered with ability to sleep'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Patient was in no acute distress with no evidence'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Gabapentin', 'related condition': 'Neuropathic symptoms', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Initially saw his primary care physician', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'For neuropathic symptoms', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'Encouraged to follow up with outpatient neurology'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What diagnostic test(s) were performed?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the test results (e.g., specific values, interpretations)?', 'What were the results of the test (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What medical condition was the test intended to diagnose or investigate?', 'Does the note indicate the severity of the condition based on the test results?', 'When was the test performed?'], [""What is a brief summary of the patient's condition and treatment plan at discharge?"", 'Was the patient referred to any other healthcare providers or specialists?', 'Why was the patient discharged from the care center?', 'Are there any follow-up appointments or instructions for the patient?']]",Diagnosis Tests,Discharge,Diagnosis Tests: No information,"

133570,"The patient is a 66-year-old African-American female with complex past medical history pertinent for renal failure on hemodialysis, hypertension, heart failure, and hepatitis C requiring previous liver transplantation. She had several hospitalizations for hypertension and pulmonary edema. She was maintained on carvedilol and nifedipine for hypertension, as well tacrolimus for her liver transplantation immunosuppression. Regarding her hypertension, her systolic blood pressures were consistently 180–190 mmHg. Her social history was pertinent for ongoing tobacco use, with an approximately fifty pack-year smoking history.\nThe patient was evaluated for a scalp lesion. This nodule was problematic for her as it caused discomfort when she brushed her hair. She denied ever noting drainage, bleeding, or spontaneous pain in the area. On exam, the nodule was located on the superior-most portion of her scalp and approximately 1.5 cm in size. It was mobile, firm, and non-tender. Due to the nature of the nodule, it was believed to be a lipoma or a sebaceous cyst. As this nodule was problematic for her, she elected to pursue excision. Surgical consent was obtained.\nThe day of surgery, her systolic blood pressure was elevated to 190 mmHg. After several hours of pharmacologic intervention, her systolic blood pressure was able to be brought down to the 160 mmHg range, and she was taken to the operating room. Given her hypertension and complex medical history pertinent for persistent pulmonary edema, her excision was performed under local anesthesia.\nThe patient was placed on the operating table in supine position. Clindamycin was given within half hour of skin incision. The lesion appeared to have a small umbilicated area, raising the suspicion that the lesion was actually a sebaceous cyst. After infusion of local anesthetic, an elliptical incision was made in a transverse fashion over the lesion. Sharp dissection was used to encircle the lesion which was approximately two centimeters by two centimeters in size. The lesion was excised in its entirety without breaking the capsule. The specimen was placed in formalin and sent to the pathology lab.\nThe wound bed oozed blood diffusely given the patient's end-stage renal disease, hypertension, and the location of the lesion. Hemostasis was obtained using a small patch of hemostatic product and electrosurgical energy. The deep dermal layer was closed with interrupted 3–0 absorbable braided sutures. The subcuticular layer was closed with 4-0 monofilament absorbable suture. A high viscosity tissue adhesive was applied to the skin.\nGrossly, the specimen was a 2.4 × 1.1 × 1.2 cm tan-pink, hair-bearing skin ellipse with attached soft tissue. It consisted of a cystic cavity filled with a yellow to clear gelatinous material.\nHistologically, there was a well-circumscribed neoplasm composed of a proliferation of monomorphous basaloid and squamous epithelial cells arranged around ducts and cystic spaces. There was a fibrovascular myxoid stroma and there were areas of necrosis en mass. Final pathologic interpretation revealed a poroid hidradenoma.","{'visit motivation': 'Evaluation for a scalp lesion', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '66', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'African-American', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Renal failure on hemodialysis, hypertension, heart failure, hepatitis C, previous liver transplantation', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'Ongoing tobacco use, approximately fifty pack-year smoking history'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Scalp lesion causing discomfort', 'Type': 'Excision', 'time': 'Day of surgery not specified', 'outcome': 'Lesion excised in its entirety', 'details': 'Performed under local anesthesia due to hypertension and persistent pulmonary edema; lesion was approximately two centimeters by two centimeters in size'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Discomfort when brushing hair', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Scalp', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Brushing hair', 'details': 'No drainage, bleeding, or spontaneous pain'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination of scalp lesion', 'result': 'Nodule located on the superior-most portion of the scalp, approximately 1.5 cm in size, mobile, firm, and non-tender', 'details': 'Suspected to be a lipoma or a sebaceous cyst, with a small umbilicated area noted during surgery'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'Hypertension', 'time': 'Day of surgery', 'details': 'Systolic blood pressure elevated to 190 mmHg, reduced to the 160 mmHg range after pharmacologic intervention'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Pharmacologic intervention for hypertension', 'related condition': 'Hypertension', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Day of surgery', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To reduce elevated systolic blood pressure', 'reaction to treatment': 'Blood pressure reduced to the 160 mmHg range', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Carvedilol and nifedipine', 'related condition': 'Hypertension', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Management of hypertension', 'reaction to treatment': 'Systolic blood pressures were consistently 180–190 mmHg', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Tacrolimus', 'related condition': 'Liver transplantation immunosuppression', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To prevent organ rejection post liver transplantation', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Clindamycin', 'related condition': 'Prophylaxis for surgery', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Within half hour of skin incision', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Antibiotic prophylaxis for surgery', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Where was the patient admitted (e.g., hospital name, department)?', 'What is the date the patient was admitted?', 'How long did the patient stay in the care center?

She had a history of some psychiatric illness a few years back and was on medications, which were later discontinued, but details of the same could not be obtained owing to poor documentation. During location of the epidural space, the initial attempt resulted in a dural puncture, following which the epidural space was located at the immediate upper spinous interspace and anaesthesia proceeded uneventfully with endotracheal intubation. She was extubated on table, Inj morphine 3 mg administered through the epidural catheter for relief of postoperative pain, and was shifted to the postoperative ward without any major concerns.\nFive hours later, she was found catatonic in bed with total loss of limb movements. Plantars were flexor and pupils normal. Eyes were half-open, mouth slightly open and the patient held this posture ignoring any verbal contact or external stimulus. She was actively resisting eyelid elevation and blinking in response to visual threat. The patient was haemodynamically stable and arterial blood gases (ABG), serum electrolytes, and blood glucose levels were unremarkable. In view of the previous dural puncture, egress of the epidurally administered morphine into the intrathecal space was considered and naloxone administered to antagonize its effects. In about an hour, the patient was fully conscious, oriented, and responding to oral commands. However, the patient was not vocalizing and was still keeping her mouth slightly open. Upon being instructed to close her mouth, the patient indicated that she was unable to do so and TMJ dislocation was considered.

Also he developed two episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures. His serum Na+ was found to be very low (102 mEq/ml). He was also put on tab levetiracetam 1000 mg for seizure prophylaxis. At the time of discharge after 6 days of hospitalization his serum Na+ was 131 mEq/ml. His hyponatremia had been corrected rapidly (by 13 mEq/ml in initial 8 h). He had undergone neurosurgery for non-functional pituitary macroadenoma 10 years back. He was not taking any hormone supplements. It was hypothesized that he might have been having chronic hyponatremia due to hypopituitarism. Patient developed rigidity and associated symptoms after 6 days of sodium correction. He also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain which did not reveal any abnormality except for chronic ischemic changes in the bilateral centrum semiovale.\nDetailed assessment did not reveal psychiatric symptoms or any previous psychiatric illness nor was there any history of substance abuse. There was no family history of any psychiatric illness as well. From the history and review of medical records, a provisional diagnosis of CPEM was made. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome was ruled out as patient was not subjected to any antipsychotics in previous hospital as per records. Moreover, serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were normal. He was started on oral trihexyphenidyl (centrally acting anticholinergic) 1 mg TDS along with supportive treatment.\nMRI brain was repeated on day 4 of admission (after 5 days of onset of symptoms) which showed pontine hyperintensities and bilateral basal ganglia (caudate and putamen) hyperintensities on T2W1 and FLAIR sequences confirming the diagnosis of CPEM (secondary to rapid correction of hyponatremia) [Figures and ].\nPatient's symptoms started improving dramatically after the treatment was started. Hormone supplementation was started following reports of low Adrinocorticotrophic Hormone (ACTH), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Leutinising Hormone (LH) levels. After 3 days of hospitalization, he developed behavioral symptoms for which psychiatric consultation was again taken. He was found to have disturbed sleep, irritability, suspiciousness toward a fellow patients in the ward and aggression toward treating resident doctors. He developed delusion of persecution and reference, claiming that a female patient on neighboring bed was passing insulting remarks to him indirectly when talking to others and was also teasing him through her gestures. He would appear restless and kept pacing in ward in anger. He was fully conscious and oriented with clear sensorium. No apparent mood symptoms could be noticed. He did not have any Schneiderian First rank symptoms. Possibility of any substance abuse in ward was ruled out. He was started on quetiapine 50 mg and dose was increased to 100 mg over a period of 3 days. He tolerated it well and his psychotic symptoms started improving over a period of 4 weeks. He was discharged from the ward after his extrapyramidal symptoms got completely resolved. During follow-up visits, trihexyphenidyl was tapered off over next 1 month and quetiapine was gradually tapered off over next 6 months without any new symptoms. The patient achieved complete remission and started attending office subsequently.","{'visit motivation': 'Acute onset, generalized rigidity and tremors of all limbs, difficulty speaking and swallowing, slowness of movements, masked facies, and decreased blinking', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Managed for episodes of vomiting and decreased food intake associated with confusion, lethargy, disorientation to time and place, and two episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures', 'date': 'None', 'duration': '6 days', 'care center details': 'medical ICU'}], 'patient information': {'age': '53', 'sex': 'male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'No family history of any psychiatric illness', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Hyponatremia, history of neurosurgery for non-functional pituitary macroadenoma 10 years back, not taking any hormone supplements, chronic hyponatremia due to hypopituitarism suspected', 'psychological context': 'No psychiatric symptoms or previous psychiatric illness', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Non-functional pituitary macroadenoma', 'Type': 'Neurosurgery', 'time': '10 years back', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Generalized rigidity and tremors', 'intensity of symptom': 'Acute onset', 'location': 'All limbs', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Associated with difficulty speaking and swallowing, slowness of movements, masked facies, and decreased blinking'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain', 'result': 'No abnormality except for chronic ischemic changes in the bilateral centrum semiovale', 'details': 'MRI repeated on day 4 of admission showed pontine hyperintensities and bilateral basal ganglia (caudate and'}, {'name': 'Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels', 'result': 'Normal', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Serum Na+ level', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Very low (102 mEq/ml) upon initial admission, 131 mEq/ml at the time of discharge', 'condition': 'Hyponatremia', 'time': 'Initial admission and discharge after 6 days of hospitalization', 'details': 'Hyponatremia had been corrected rapidly (by 13 mEq/ml in initial 8 h)'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Tab levetiracetam', 'related condition': 'Seizure prophylaxis', 'dosage': '1000 mg', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'For seizure prophylaxis', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Oral trihexyphenidyl (centrally acting anticholinergic)', 'related condition': 'CPEM', 'dosage': '1 mg', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'TDS (three times a day)', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'For the treatment of CPEM', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'Started along with supportive treatment'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['How long did the patient receive the treatment?', 'What was the dosage of the medication or treatment?', 'How often was the medication or treatment administered?', 'What medication or treatment was administered?', 'Did the patient experience any side effects or reactions to the treatment?', 'When was the treatment initiated?', 'Are there any additional details mentioned about the treatment (e.g., route of administration, specific instructions)?', 'What specific condition was the treatment intended to address?', 'Why was this treatment initiated?'], ['Where is the symptom located (e.g., body part)?', 'Are there any behaviors that affect the symptom (e.g., activities that worsen it)?', 'How does the symptom change over time (e.g., constant, intermittent, worsening)?', 'What is the intensity of the symptom (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)?', 'When did the symptom(s) start?', 'What specific symptom(s) did the patient report?']]",Treatments,Symptoms,"

135090,"A 21-year-old primigravida was taken up for emergency cesarean section, due to non-progression of labor. Lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) was done under spinal anesthesia with a 25G needle in the L3-4 space and 3 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with patient in the right lateral position. After the spinal anesthesia, a wedge was kept under the buttocks of the patient to avoid post spinal hypotension. Cesarean section was completed in 43 minutes. In the immediate postoperative period, she noticed inability to dorsiflex the right ankle, (). There was no sensory loss in the extremity.

59454,"A 65-year-old man presented to the emergency room with a 10-day history of worsening dyspnea. His medical history was significant for active diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and he had recently completed his fifth cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy 12 days prior to hospital presentation. On examination, he was in obvious respiratory distress. He was tachypneic and tachycardic but maintaining his oxygen saturation. He had audible biphasic stridor and was able to speak in single words only. Transnasal flexible laryngoscopy revealed that the vocal cords were structurally normal but fixed in the paramedian position (Figure ).\nThe remainder of the head and neck examination was unremarkable. He had previously undergone transnasal flexible laryngoscopy for an unrelated otolaryngology presentation and was found to have normal vocal cord movement at that time, which lead to the conclusion that the BLVCP was a new development. There had been no preceding laryngeal trauma or intubation in the interim.\nThe patient was admitted for further workup and management. Intravenous dexamethasone and nebulized epinephrine were administered with minimal effect. The patient gradually compensated over the next 24 hours and a tracheostomy was avoided. He denied dysphagia and continued on a normal oral diet. A computed tomography scan of the head, neck, and chest showed no structural lesions along the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerves to account for the acute BLVCP, and laboratory studies showed no evidence of infectious or autoimmune cause for his presentation. In the absence of other possible etiologies, it was presumed that toxicity related to the R-CHOP regimen was the cause of the BLVCP. The patient was discharged home after three days of observation with a clinical improvement in his respiratory effort; however, he continued to have complete BLVCP on serial flexible laryngoscopy. Further chemotherapy doses were canceled pending resolution of the acute BLVCP.\nThe patient was reviewed four weeks post-discharge, at which point repeat flexible laryngoscopy showed a flicker of movement in both vocal cords. Repeat flexible laryngoscopy at three months showed near-complete recovery of vocal cord movement bilaterally. He was recommenced on an alternative chemotherapy regimen with a good response and remains disease-free with normal laryngeal function at three years following his initial presentation.","{'visit motivation': 'Worsening dyspnea', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Worsening dyspnea and respiratory distress', 'date': '12 days after the fifth cycle of chemotherapy', 'duration': 'Three days', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '65', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Active diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Dyspnea', 'intensity of symptom': 'Worsening', 'location': 'None', 'time': '10-day history', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Patient was in respiratory distress, tachypneic, tachycardic, had audible biphasic stridor, and could speak in single words only.'}, {'name of symptom': 'Bilateral vocal cord paralysis (BLVCP)', 'intensity of symptom': 'Complete', 'location': 'Vocal cords', 'time': 'Acute onset', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Vocal cords were structurally normal but fixed in the paramedian position.'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Transnasal flexible laryngoscopy', 'result': 'Vocal cords fixed in the paramedian position', 'details': 'Vocal cords were structurally normal; previously had normal vocal cord movement.'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Computed tomography scan of the head, neck, and chest', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'No structural lesions along the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerves', 'condition': 'Bilateral vocal cord paralysis (BLVCP)', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'CT scan showed no structural lesions to account for the acute BLVCP.'}, {'test': 'Laboratory studies', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'No evidence of infectious or autoimmune cause', 'condition': 'Bilateral vocal cord paralysis (BLVCP)', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Presumed that toxicity related to the R-CHOP regimen was the cause of the BLVCP.'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Intravenous dexamethasone and nebulized epinephrine', 'related condition': 'Respiratory distress', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'During hospital admission', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To manage respiratory distress', 'reaction to treatment': 'Minimal effect', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'R-CHOP chemotherapy', 'related condition': 'Diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Fifth cycle completed 12 days prior to hospital presentation', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Treatment for DLBCL', 'reaction to treatment': 'Presumed toxicity causing BLVCP', 'details': 'Further chemotherapy doses were canceled pending resolution of the acute BLVCP.'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'Clinical improvement in respiratory effort', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'Discharged home after three days of observation with clinical improvement in respiratory effort but continued to have complete BLVCP on serial flexible laryngoscopy.'}}","[['Are there any specific details mentioned about the test results (e.g., specific values, interpretations)?', 'What medical condition was the test intended to diagnose or investigate?', 'What were the results of the test (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'Does the note indicate the severity of the condition based on the test results?', 'What diagnostic test(s) were performed?', 'When was the test performed?'], ['How long did the patient stay in the care center?

20772,"A 67-year-old Japanese man presented with dysphagia. He had a medical history of exploratory laparotomy for ileus but no history of anticoagulant medication. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed type III esophageal cancer in the middle thoracic esophagus (Fig. a). An upper GI series revealed an irregular stricture in the middle thoracic esophagus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a primary tumor and swollen cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. b, c). Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) also revealed a primary tumor in the esophagus (Fig. d) and swollen lymph nodes in the mediastinum with abnormal uptake.\nAs a result, he was diagnosed with middle thoracic esophageal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) and T3N3M0 in clinical stage III according to the criteria of the Japan Esophageal Society. He was treated with combination chemotherapy of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil as neoadjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy for 2 months resulted in shrinkage of the primary tumor of the esophagus and lymph nodes in the mediastinum (Fig. e–g). FDG-PET revealed decreased uptake in the primary tumor and lymph nodes in the mediastinum (Fig. h).\nAfter chemotherapy, he underwent subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy and gastric conduit reconstruction through the retrosternal route by thoracoscopy and laparotomy. Postoperative care was performed under mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). On postoperative day (POD) 1, mechanical ventilation was terminated because of a good respiratory condition. However, he suffered from dyspnea and severe acidosis and chest X-ray examination revealed right pneumothorax, which was observed 5 h after extubation. Furthermore, air leakage was observed from the water seal chamber of the chest drain system. We thought that the respiratory disorder was caused by the right pneumothorax. Therefore, mechanical ventilation was started again. After that, it became clear that the cause of the pneumothorax was the air sucked from his drain insertion site. A few sutures were added at his drain insertion site. And we decided to continue his treatment under mechanical ventilation until the respiratory problems were improved.\nOn POD 2, the pneumothorax was improved. However, he had diarrhea, fever, and low blood pressure, which were treated with catecholamines. At the time, his abdomen was flat and soft. Laboratory findings revealed worsened inflammation with a decline in the white blood cell count, deviated enzyme levels, renal failure, and acidosis (Table ). All things considered, severe sepsis with multi-organ failure was suspected. Enhanced CT revealed bowel dilation with increases in the intestinal fluid, including the gastric conduit (Fig. a). There were no findings of arterial thrombus, including in the superior mesenteric artery (Fig. b). Upper GI endoscopy revealed necrotic mucosal changes in the whole gastric conduit (Fig. c). Therefore, septic shock caused by gastric conduit necrosis was diagnosed, and an emergency operation was planned. When we explored the abdominal cavity, we found not only gastric conduit necrosis but also intermittent necrotic changes in the intestinal wall from the jejunum to the rectum (Fig. ). Based on the findings, we considered a diagnosis of NOMI. The extent of excision was determined first by macroscopy. The non-enhanced lesion by indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence in the small intestine was excised additionally (Fig. ). As a result, we performed an excision of the gastric conduit and 2 m of the small intestine, which was followed by a total colectomy (Fig. ). After resection, the length of the remnant jejunum was 1 m and 80 cm. We considered re-reconstruction after the removal of the gastric conduit. However, we decided that re-reconstruction could not be made because the surgical stress of re-reconstruction was intolerable considering his critical status. Esophagostomy, jejunostomy, and enterostomy for nutrition were performed (Fig. ).\nThe pathological findings revealed shedding of the epithelium, hemorrhagic necrosis of the mucosa, capillary dilation of the submucosa, and transmural necrobiosis in the gastric conduit, small intestine, and large intestine, which were compatible with NOMI. Almost all of the lesions had no thrombosis in the resected specimens. After the second operation, sepsis was improved. Furthermore, 0.01 μg/kg/min of prostaglandin E1 had been administered intravenously for a week, and enhanced CT findings revealed no ischemic changes in the residual small intestine after the second operation. On POD 16, the patient was discharged from the ICU. On POD 122, he was self-discharged from our hospital after a long period of nutritional support, including total parenteral nutrition and enteral nutrition.\nThe pathological diagnosis of esophageal cancer was squamous cell carcinoma and pT3N1M0 stage III. On POD 64, follow-up CT revealed the recurrence of esophageal cancer at the para-aortic lymph node. Although, we considered re-reconstruction of the esophagus, we abandoned this strategy, because his condition could not tolerate surgical stress, and recurrence of esophageal cancer was confirmed. He died of the recurrence of lung metastasis from esophageal cancer 9 months after the operation.","{'visit motivation': 'Presented with dysphagia', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Diagnosed with middle thoracic esophageal cancer and treatment', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '67', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'Japanese', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Exploratory laparotomy for ileus', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Middle thoracic esophageal cancer', 'Type': 'Subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy and gastric conduit reconstruction', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Postoperative care in ICU, complication of right pneumothorax after extubation', 'details': 'Surgery performed through the retrosternal route by thoracoscopy and laparotomy'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Dysphagia', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name of symptom': 'Dyspnea', 'intensity of symptom': 'Severe', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'Postoperative day 1, 5 hours after extubation', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Associated with severe acidosis and right pneumothorax'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy', 'result': 'Type III esophageal cancer in the middle thoracic esophagus', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Upper GI series', 'result': 'Irregular stricture in the middle thoracic esophagus', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Computed tomography (CT)', 'result': 'Primary tumor and swollen cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Chest X-ray examination', 'result': 'Right pneumothorax', 'details': 'Performed on postoperative day 1 after the patient suffered from dyspnea and severe acidosis'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)', 'severity': 'Clinical stage III', 'result': 'Primary tumor in the esophagus and swollen lymph nodes in the mediastinum with abnormal uptake', 'condition': 'Middle thoracic esophageal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma), T3N3M0', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Post-chemotherapy FDG-PET revealed decreased uptake in the primary tumor and lymph nodes in the mediastinum'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Combination chemotherapy', 'related condition': 'Middle thoracic esophageal cancer', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': '2 months', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Neoadjuvant therapy', 'reaction to treatment': 'Shrinkage of the primary tumor of the esophagus and lymph nodes in the mediastinum', 'details': 'Chemotherapy of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil'}, {'name': 'Mechanical ventilation', 'related condition': 'Postoperative care', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Postoperative day 1', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Due to dyspnea and severe acidosis after surgery', 'reaction to treatment': 'Reinitiated due to respiratory disorder caused by right pneumothorax', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[[""What is the patient's age?"", ""What is the patient's ethnicity?

Four days later, he developed worsening joint pain, lower extremity calf pain, and hoarse voice. Examination at this time was notable for 3/5 strength in his lower extremities. He was admitted to the hospital and treated with 50 mg intravenous hydrocortisone every 12 hours for three days and intravenous fluids for a suspected postviral myositis. His symptoms resolved, and he was discharged home.\nFive days afterwards, he was readmitted to a different hospital for dysphagia and concern of aspiration pneumonia. A gastric tube was placed, he was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole, and he was sent to a rehabilitation facility. Of note, he was not treated with a quinolone or aminoglycoside antibiotic. Another four days later, he presented to our hospital with worsening pneumonia. At this time, physical exam revealed decreased proximal muscle and grip strength, weak palate elevation, diplopia upon prolonged upward gaze, and 3/5 strength in lower extremities.

106711,"An 18-year-old boy presented to our outpatient department with a history of fall while trying to jump across a wall 6 months ago. After the injury, the patient was not able to stand and walk. The patient was initially attended by a local practitioner. The initial radiographs were inconclusive for any fracture. The patient was managed by wooden splint and bed rest for 6 weeks were advised. However, after 3 weeks, the patient removed the splint by itself and started walking with a wooden stick.\nAt the time of presentation to us, the patient was able to walk normally. The patient mainly complained of loss of active extension of the knee in the sitting position and a palpable gap over the upper part of the patella (). The patient was able to actively flex his knee, but an active extension was minimally possible. The patient was able to extend his limb by internal rotation most probably using tensor fascia lata.\nConcerning the extent of the injury, the patient underwent radiographic evaluation which showed a small bony avulsion at the upper pole of the patella. Anteroposterior and lateral radiograph () were taken, which showed the fracture line along with displaced fragments, which appeared to be a sleeve-like fracture of the upper pole of the patella.\nAfter the complete evaluation, the patient was operated under spinal-epidural anesthesia. The fracture was approached through a suprapatellar incision. We found that the articular cartilage of the patella and portion of patellar retinaculum was avulsed, along with small bony fragments. The fragment was anatomically reduced and fixed with 4 non-resorbable osseous sutures (Ethibond No. 5).

92693,"A 13-year-old male presented with a fungating lesion on the scalp. He had sustained flame burns at the age of three. The lesion was never grafted and failed to heal completely. The primary care centre continued to manage the wound conservatively with frequent dressings. Eventually, a biopsy was performed and a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed. He was referred to our tertiary centre for further management.\nHis main complaint was pain and a foul-smelling ulcer with a mucopurulent discharge. Specifically, the patient did not give any history suggestive of epilepsy or personality change. He was noted to be underweight for his age. On examination the lesion occupied the entire central vertex of the scalp []. The tumour measured 12 × 15cm. The central portion of the lesion was pulsatile. Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy was present. On neurological examination no deficits were identified. No abnormalities were noted on the cardio-respiratory and abdominal examination. Blood investigations revealed microcytic anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia. The human immunodeficiency virus serology was negative.\nInvestigations included a skull radiograph, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These revealed extensive tumour infiltration of the soft tissue with underlying full thickness bilateral parietal bone erosion []. The depth of the infiltration included the dura and the cortex of the left cerebral hemisphere with underlying oedema of the brain []. A filling defect in the superior sagittal sinus indicated a thrombus. A chest roentegram and an abdominal ultrasound excluded metastatic disease in the lungs and liver respectively.\nThe cancer was staged clinically as T4N1M0. With Neurosurgical assistance the resection of the lesion was planned.\nAt surgery, the scalp, the involved cranial bones and dura were excised with 2cm tumour free peripheral margins. A suction-assisted resection of the involved cerebral cortex was done to the depth of normal brain tissue. The soft tissue defect measured 20 × 17 cm []. Our plan was to cover the defect with the anterolateral thigh flap. The tensor fascia lata was to serve as vascularised dural substitute. The flap harvest was abandoned after suitable calibre perforators could not be identified. A latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was then used for cover. Lyoplant® (bovine pericardium) was used as a dural substitute. The flap was anastomosed to the superficial temporal vessels.\nHistological diagnosis confirmed an invasive acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma, an aggressive pathological type which is poorly differentiated, extending into the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The final histopathology result differed from the initial biopsy result due to a larger sample size of the former as well as poorly differentiated type cells were noted within the centre of the lesion. Abundant scar tissue and perineural invasion was noted with no vascular involvement. Brain and dura confirmed the presence of tumour in the deep resection margin. The interpretation of tumour clearance was inconclusive in view of the method of resection of the involved brain tissue.\nThe patient's postoperative recovery and wound healing was uneventful []. The patient had a near total right-sided hemiplegia of immediate onset following the surgery. Four weeks postoperatively, the bilateral cervical lymph nodes showed no signs of regression. Instead, the distribution and the size of the nodes had increased. A fine needle aspiration biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic disease. Therapeutic bilateral selective cervical lymph node dissection, levels 1-5, was performed five weeks after the primary excision. Histology confirmed metastases to eight out of 90 lymph nodes. The patient was referred to the oncologists for further management. Three months later a large lymph node was detected in the left pre-auricular region which was excised and confirmed as metastatic disease. Chemotherapy was advised and six cycles of Taxotere and Cisplatin were administered. At nine months post surgical excision there was no evidence of local recurrence or metastatic disease. The patient defaulted on the subsequent planning of radiotherapy to the brain. At one year he presented to the oncologist with a history of seizures and weakness in the right upper and lower limb. A scalp recurrence was also noted. A CT scan of the brain showed left intraparenchymal parietal lobe mass lesion with solid and cystic components. The lesion was not amenable to neurosurgical intervention. The patient was offered palliative radiotherapy to the whole brain at a dosage of 3Gy each over nine cycles. The response was poor and the patient was discharged to the care of a hospice resulting in his demise three months later.","{'visit motivation': 'Fungating lesion on the scalp', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Management of a fungating lesion on the scalp', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Primary care centre'}], 'patient information': {'age': '13 years old', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'Underweight for his age', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Sustained flame burns at the age of three, lesion never grafted and failed to heal completely', 'psychological context': 'No history suggestive of epilepsy or personality change', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma', 'Type': 'Resection of the lesion, excision of the scalp, involved cranial bones and dura, suction-assisted resection of the involved cerebral cortex', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'Planned to cover the defect with the anterolateral thigh flap'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Pain, foul-smelling ulcer with mucopurulent discharge', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Scalp', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Lesion occupied the entire central vertex of the scalp, tumour measured 12 × 15cm, central portion was pulsatile, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Neurological examination', 'result': 'No deficits identified', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Cardio-respiratory and abdominal examination', 'result': 'No abnormalities noted', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Blood investigations', 'result': 'Microcytic anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Biopsy', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Confirmed well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma', 'condition': 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Skull radiograph, CT, MRI', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Extensive tumour infiltration of the soft tissue with underlying full thickness bilateral parietal bone erosion, infiltration included the dura and the cortex of the left cerebral hemisphere with underlying oedema of the brain, a filling defect in the superior sagittal sinus indicating a thrombus', 'condition': 'Tumour infiltration and bone erosion', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Chest roentgenogram and abdominal ultrasound', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Excluded metastatic disease in the lungs and liver', 'condition': 'Metastatic disease exclusion', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Conservative management', 'related condition': 'Fungating lesion on the scalp', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'Frequent dressings', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Failed to heal completely after burn injury', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'Lesion was managed conservatively at the primary care centre'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'Referred to tertiary centre for further management', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What is the date the patient was admitted?', 'Where was the patient admitted (e.g., hospital name, department)?', ""What is the primary reason for the patient's admission?"", 'How long did the patient stay in the care center?

She exhibited bilateral leg edema on examination without crackles or jugular venous distention. Brain natriuretic peptide was elevated to 1330 pg/mL. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly with minimal interstitial edema. Echocardiography from the other hospital showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 50%, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 56 mmHg, and normal left ventricular diastolic filling. Recurrent exacerbation of CHF secondary to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) triggered by medication noncompliance was initially diagnosed, and the patient was started on intravenous furosemide. However, no clinical improvement was noted with no reasonable urine output. The medical team doubted the diagnosis of CHF exacerbation and started to do more thorough history taking and a comprehensive physical examination.\nThe patient had a history of breast cancer and underwent left lumpectomy followed by 4 cycles of chemotherapy using docetaxel/cyclophosphamide and radiation therapy about a year ago. She was given 134 mg of docetaxel and 1,074 mg of cyclophosphamide on a monthly basis. On repeat examination, she demonstrated diffuse thickening/sclerosis of bilateral hands that crossed metacarpophalangeal joints extending up to bilateral proximal upper extremities (). Extensive sclerosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue of anterior chest wall and the left breast were also noted. Patient endorsed that she started to have pain and stiffness of both hands right after she finished the last cycle of chemotherapy. Echocardiography before the chemotherapy showed EF of 55%, PAP of 26 mmHg, and normal left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling. LV size has been normal without change before and after the chemotherapy. Therefore, her estimated systolic PAP has increased by more than 2-fold after the chemotherapy with newly developing skin sclerosis. Docetaxel-related systemic sclerosis was suspected. Serologic test showed positive antinuclear antibody, but negative anticentromere and anti-Scl-70 antibodies. Pulmonary function test was normal with slightly decreased diffusing capacity. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest did not show interstitial lung disease. Finally, it was noted that she met the 2013 American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria of Systemic Sclerosis as she demonstrated skin thickening of the fingers of both hands extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints (score 9) and PAH (score 2). Per the criteria, patients with a total score of ≥9 are classified as having definite systemic sclerosis [].\nWe discontinued diuretic treatment and continued on beta-blocker with calcium-channel blocker. Patient's clinical condition improved and was discharged with follow-up appointment with Rheumatology and Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) clinic.\nUpon follow-up chart review, the patient is currently following Rheumatology, Pulmonology, and Dermatology but is also on hemodialysis given worsening renal function with following Nephrology. Renal biopsy was performed and it showed thrombotic microangiopathy pattern (classic ""onion-peeling"" appearance) which is suggestive of scleroderma per pathologic documentation. She was diagnosed with scleroderma renal crisis by Nephrology and was started on captopril. Patient is currently stable with normal blood pressure and stable serum creatinine levels.","{'visit motivation': 'Shortness of breath', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Acute exacerbation of CHF', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'Discharged one week earlier', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '49', 'sex': 'Woman', 'ethnicity': 'African American', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'History of breast cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and CHF', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Breast cancer', 'Type': 'Left lumpectomy', 'time': 'About a year ago', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Bilateral leg edema', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Legs', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'No crackles or jugular venous distention'}, {'name of symptom': 'Pain and stiffness of both hands', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Both hands', 'time': 'Started after the last cycle of chemotherapy', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Diffuse thickening/sclerosis of bilateral hands that crossed metacarpophalangeal joints extending up to bilateral proximal upper extremities'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Exhibited bilateral leg edema without crackles or jugular venous distention; diffuse thickening/sclerosis of bilateral hands and extensive sclerosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue of anterior chest wall and the left breast'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Elevated to 1330 pg/mL', 'condition': 'CHF', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Chest radiograph', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Cardiomegaly with minimal interstitial edema', 'condition': 'CHF', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Echocardiography', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'EF of 50%, PAP of 56 mmHg, normal left ventricular diastolic filling', 'condition': 'CHF', 'time': 'From the other hospital', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Echocardiography', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'EF of 55%, PAP of 26 mmHg, normal LV diastolic filling, normal LV size', 'condition': 'Before chemotherapy', 'time': 'Before chemotherapy', 'details': 'Estimated systolic PAP increased by more than 2-fold after chemotherapy with newly developing skin sclerosis'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Oral furosemide and carvedilol', 'related condition': 'CHF', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'At discharge from the other hospital', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To manage CHF', 'reaction to treatment': 'Lost prescription for carvedilol and did not take it since discharge', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Intravenous furosemide', 'related condition': 'CHF', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'After admission for recurrent exacerbation of CHF', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Recurrent exacerbation of CHF', 'reaction to treatment': 'No clinical improvement, no reasonable urine output', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Chemotherapy', 'related condition': 'Breast cancer', 'dosage': '134 mg of docetaxel and 1,074 mg of cyclophosphamide on a monthly basis', 'time': 'About a year ago', 'frequency': 'Monthly', 'duration': '4 cycles', 'reason for taking': 'Breast cancer treatment', 'reaction to treatment': 'Developing skin sclerosis and increased PAP after chemotherapy', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['How long did the patient receive the treatment?', 'Did the patient experience any side effects or reactions to the treatment?', 'What medication or treatment was administered?', 'Why was this treatment initiated?', 'What specific condition was the treatment intended to address?', 'What was the dosage of the medication or treatment?', 'Are there any additional details mentioned about the treatment (e.g., route of administration, specific instructions)?', 'When was the treatment initiated?', 'How often was the medication or treatment administered?'], ['What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?']]",Treatments,Medical Examinations,"

94905,"An 85-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to hospital following three collapse episodes with transient loss of consciousness at home. Each episode was short-lived lasting several minutes. Apart from mild abdominal generalized discomfort, there were no other symptoms. There was no history of recent trauma. He had no history of similar episodes but was known to have severe aortic stenosis, type 2 diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension and a previous duodenal ulcer bleed.\nAt that time, he was taking aspirin, bisoprolol, omeprazole and ramipril. He lived with his daughter and was independent with his activities of daily living. He had not smoked for 35 years and his alcohol consumption was minimal.\nOn examination, he was apyrexial, oxygen saturation was 100% on air. His blood pressure was 80/40 mmHg. He was persistently hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. There was an ejection systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation. His venous pressure was not elevated and there was no leg edema. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Upper and lower limb pulses were equal bilaterally. Examination of his abdomen revealed mild epigastric discomfort, but there was no rebound or peritonism and bowel sounds were present. Per rectal examination was normal.\nInitial blood results showed a hemoglobin of 11.3 (13-18 g/dL), white cell count of 11 (4-11 × 109/L), and platelets of 136 (150-450 × 109/L). Coagulation profile, renal function and liver function tests were within normal limits. His chest radiograph was normal and his electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. At admission, he was taken to the coronary care unit for cardiac monitoring because of the history of collapse with loss of consciousness which was thought to be related to his aortic stenosis. An urgent echocardiogram was performed which showed evidence of aortic stenosis, but no evidence of critical stenosis with good ejection fraction > 55% and good biventricular contraction.\nA repeat full blood count showed that his hemoglobin had fallen to 4.9 g/dL and he was transfused with red cells, platelets and cryoprecipitate. The impression was that this patient had a possible dissecting thoracic aneurysm that was possibly extending into the abdomen. He was transferred to the intensive care unit.\nIn view of the differential diagnosis of a possible dissection, an urgent chest and abdomen CT scan was performed which showed normal appearances of the thoracic and abdominal aorta with no evidence of aneurysm or dissection. However, the scan revealed a large amount of free intra-peritoneal fluid with areas of low attenuation in the right lobe of the liver. The appearances were concluded to be of metastatic disease within the liver (Figures , , . No primary tumor was identified. A diagnostic peritoneal tap was performed and frank blood was aspirated confirming that there was hemoperitoneum. An acute intra-abdominal bleed from the liver metastatic disease was diagnosed.\nOur patient had an esophageal gastro-duodenal endoscopy as he had been taking aspirin and had a past history of a duodenal ulcer. This did not show any evidence of bleeding. A rigid sigmoidoscopy was also normal.\nWhilst on the intensive care ward, our patient's blood pressure subsequently improved and he did not require inotropic support. He had no further hypotensive episodes and improved during his stay on the ward. Given the advanced nature of his hepatic metastases, he did not wish to have further investigations to identify the primary source of the metastases and decided on conservative supportive treatment, as advised by the oncologists. He was referred to the Macmillan and Hospital Palliative Care Team. Subsequently, he died three months later. A post-mortem was not performed.","{'visit motivation': 'Three collapse episodes with transient loss of consciousness at home', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Collapse episodes with transient loss of consciousness', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Coronary care unit for cardiac monitoring'}], 'patient information': {'age': '85', 'sex': 'Man', 'ethnicity': 'Caucasian', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'Lives with his daughter, independent with activities of daily living', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Severe aortic stenosis, type 2 diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, previous duodenal ulcer bleed', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'Minimal', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'Had not smoked for 35 years'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Collapse episodes with transient loss of consciousness', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'Each episode lasting several minutes', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Apart from mild abdominal generalized discomfort, no other symptoms'}, {'name of symptom': 'Mild abdominal generalized discomfort', 'intensity of symptom': 'Mild', 'location': 'Abdominal', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Apyrexial, oxygen saturation 100% on air, blood pressure 80/40 mmHg, persistently hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, ejection systolic murmur on cardiac auscultation, normal venous pressure, no leg edema, clear lungs on auscultation, equal bilateral upper and lower limb pulses, mild epigastric discomfort without rebound or peritonism, present bowel sounds, normal per rectal examination'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Blood test', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Hemoglobin 11.3, white cell count 11, platelets 136', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Coagulation profile, renal function and liver function tests within normal limits'}, {'test': 'Chest radiograph', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Normal', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Electrocardiogram', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Left ventricular hypertrophy', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Echocardiogram', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Evidence of aortic stenosis, no evidence of critical stenosis, ejection fraction > 55%, good biventricular contraction', 'condition': 'Aortic stenosis', 'time': 'Urgent', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Aspirin', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Bisoprolol', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Omeprazole', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Ramipril', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Why was the patient discharged from the care center?', ""What is a brief summary of the patient's condition and treatment plan at discharge?"", 'Are there any follow-up appointments or instructions for the patient?', 'Was the patient referred to any other healthcare providers or specialists?'], [""Does the note mention any recent vaccinations or the patient's immunization status?"", 'Does the note mention any relevant psychological conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression)?', ""Does the note mention the patient's exercise habits?"", 'Does the patient have any allergies to medications or other substances?', 'Does the note mention any relevant sexual history details (e.g., sexually transmitted infections)?

53327,"The patient was a 3-year-old female who presented to Myelin Disorders Clinic due to progressive neurologic regression which was first noticed at the age of 18 months. She was the only child of a consanguineous parent which was born at 39 weeks of gestational age through a Cesarean section following an uneventful delivery with birth weight and head circumference of 3550 g (Z-score +1SD) and 35.5 cm (Z-score +1SD), respectively. Her mother had received good prenatal care without any significant problems. The patient achieved her developmental milestones normally until the age of 5–6 months. At this age, she had acceptable social interactions and was able to hold her head up, could sit with one hand support, could say mama and dada, and was able to recognize her parents. Since then, developmental arrest and neurologic regression began firstly by feeding and swallowing problems, four limb dystonia, severe para-spinal muscle spasm, and dystonia causing severe opisthotonus followed by scissoring position and spasticity in lower limbs. At the age of 1.5 years, she needed to be supported significantly in order to sit. The maximum speech ability was not exceeding 2–3 incomplete words' expression, and she had several problems with feeding and swallowing as she was fed with mixed ground foods and clear drinks. She had undergone several occupational therapy sessions which were ordered by her primary care physician. She faced remarkable and more rapid neurologic regression after routine vaccination at the age of 18 months, which led to considerable feeding difficulties, the inability of word expression, and poor head and neck control. Then, she was referred to our clinic. On examination, she had low set ears, high arch palate and beaked nose, flat nasal bridge, and thick eyebrows in addition to significant four limb dystonia, truncal hypotonia, and a noticeable degree of spasticity in her distal parts of both upper and lower limbs.\nUpon the follow-up visit at 27 months of age, her main clinical findings were four limb spasticity, severe generalized dystonia, hyperreflexia with + 3 deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), and upward plantar reflex. Her weight was 8 kg (less than 3rd centile, Z-score −3SD) and HC was 47 cm (Z-score 0SD). She was taking the following medications: diazepam, tizanidine, baclofen, melatonin, and trihexyphenidyl.\nBasic metabolic tests indicated a high plasma lactate level of 39.7 mmol/L (NL < 16 mmol/L), while the results of serum ammonia, homocysteine, and metabolic screen (MS/MS) were all normal. The first brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was done at the first visit showed abnormal deep white matter signal changes especially in the posterior periventricular area of T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences, deepening of the Sylvain fissures, and mild supratentorial atrophy, in addition to exvacue ventriculomegaly (Fig. (1A, 1C white arrows)), near-normal appearance of T1-weighted sequence (Fig. (1B)), and thinning of the corpus callosum (Fig. (1D)).\nImaging findings in the second brain MRI at the age of 27 months were similar to the first MRI but the severity of atrophy had increased in both the supratentorial area and cerebellar vermis (not shown).\nAccording to the progressive patient's clinical scenario, normal basic metabolic studies, and parents' consanguinity, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was considered to diagnose a possible underlying neurodegenerative disease. In the follow-up visit, at the age of 29 months, her parents reported infrequent focal seizures; therefore, levetiracetam was prescribed for her to control the seizures. The patient was admitted into the hospital with clinical manifestations of aspiration pneumonia at the ages of 32 and 35 months due to a progressive worsening of her feeding condition. During the second hospitalization, her spasms and dystonia were aggravated which led to severe respiratory distress and admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and tracheal intubation. The laboratory tests showed a high serum lactate level of 39 mmol/L (NL < 16 mmol/L), again, while serum ammonia, homocysteine, arterial blood gas (ABG), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis results were normal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed abnormal findings due to the appearance of generalized slowing and low-voltage background without any paroxysmal epileptiform discharge. These findings were compatible with a diffuse encephalopathic process pattern. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was placed for the patient to facilitate her difficulty feeding within a short time after discharge.\nUpon the last visit, at age of 36 months, her problems especially limb spasticity and dystonia were still present but the feeding problem had been ameliorated though she had gained a weight of 300 g over 1 month after discharge. Her seizures were controlled by oral levetiracetam and rectal diazepam as needed. Her weight was 9 kg (Z-score −3SD) and her head circumference was 48 cm (Z-score 0SD). Unfortunately, she died 1 month later due to cardiorespiratory arrest at home.","{'visit motivation': 'Progressive neurologic regression', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Myelin Disorders Clinic'}], 'patient information': {'age': '3 years old', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': '3550 g (Z-score +1SD) at birth', 'height': '35.5 cm (Z-score +1SD) at birth', 'family medical history': 'Consanguineous parents', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Normal developmental milestones until 5–6 months of age, then developmental arrest and neurologic regression began', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'Routine vaccination at the age of 18 months', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'Fed with mixed ground foods and clear drinks due to feeding and swallowing problems', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Neurologic regression', 'intensity of symptom': 'Severe', 'location': 'Neurological/whole body', 'time': 'First noticed at 18 months, progressively worsening', 'temporalisation': 'Progressive', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Feeding and swallowing problems, four limb dystonia, severe para-spinal muscle spasm, dystonia causing severe opisthotonus, scissoring position, spasticity in lower limbs, needed significant support to sit, maximum speech ability of 2–3 incomplete words, poor head and neck control post-vaccination'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Low set ears, high arch palate, beaked nose, flat nasal bridge, thick eyebrows, significant four limb dystonia, truncal hypotonia, noticeable degree of spasticity in distal parts of both upper and lower limbs'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Occupational therapy', 'related condition': 'Neurologic regression', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Ordered by primary care physician', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[[""What is the motivation for the patient's visit?""], ['Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?', 'What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?']]",Visit Motivation,Medical Examinations,"

197525,"An 80-year-old man with known cervical canal stenosis due to ossification of the cervical posterior longitudinal ligament was transferred to an emergency room soon after a falling accident. The patient was alert and had complete tetraplegia, sensory deficits below the C4 cervical sensory level, and progressive restrictive respiratory failure that required assisted ventilation, and, eventually, a tracheostomy. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging showed cervical cord compression that was worse at the C3–C4 intervertebral level, and an intramedullary high signal at C3 and C4 vertebral levels, and the patient was managed conservatively. During the conventional weaning process of trials of intermittent spontaneous breathing in the ICU, an unexpected cardiac arrest made both the patient and medical staff reluctant to proceed with further weaning. Fifty-eight days after cervical cord injury, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further rehabilitation. He was fully conscious and received pressure-support mechanical ventilation with back-up rates of 16 breaths. He had total tetraplegia below shoulder girdle muscles with a preserved sensation from C2 to C3 on both sides, and a urinary obstruction. The limbs and trunk were stiff with contracture, and muscle stretch reflexes of the limbs were abolished. Neurological level of injury was C3 according to the ISNCSCI, with a total sensory score of four. There was no sensory sacral sparing, while the deep anal pressure was preserved, and the American Spinal Injury Association scale graded B. Chest roentgenogram and computerized tomography showed bilateral, widespread atelectasis. The patient occasionally showed signs of pulmonary infection. Intensive pulmonary care and rehabilitation, including physical support for expectoration, mechanically assisted removal of tracheal secretions (CoughAssist E70®, Philips Japan, Tokyo), ventilator muscle training, and management of the spasticity of the abdominal wall, resulted in the improvement of the roentgenological findings. His expiratory tidal volume (VT) measured 150 mL.\nAlthough the neurological status according to the ISNCSCI was unchanged, the patient was willing to be weaned from mechanical ventilation as his general condition improved. After informed consent was given, we attempted automated weaning from mechanical ventilation using IntelliVent®-ASV on and after 131 days of injury. IntelliVent®-ASV (Hamilton Medical AG, Switzerland) is a closed-loop ventilation mode that adjusts the pressure support in terms of the percentage of the ideal minute volume (%MV). The ideal MV (100%MV) is calculated from the patient's height and gender. Based on Otis' equation [], adaptive support ventilation will select the best VT–respiratory rate (RR) coupling for the optimal work of breathing. IntelliVent®-ASV has interrelated functions: an auto-adjustment for carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination, an auto-adjustment for oxygenation, an auto-weaning tool named Quick Wean (QW), and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The setting of the target %MV is automated based on either the monitored end-tidal CO2 or monitored spontaneous breathing rate. The auto adjustment of fraction of inspiratory oxygen or positive end-expiratory pressure is based on the monitored oxygen saturation fraction of hemoglobin with a pulse oximeter (SpO2) []. The QW mode is an optional automated weaning, and progressively reduces the pressure support, monitors for readiness-to-wean criteria, and provides the option to automatically conduct a fully controlled SBT. In the QW mode, when the spontaneous rate is less than the upper limit of the predicted target range, %MV is automatically decreased gradually to the selected level. To facilitate the recovery of VT by means of the loading work on respiratory muscles, we set the level of support to 70%MV for the QW mode. When spontaneous breathing satisfied the pre-determined conditions of oxygenation and ventilation for 1 min, the SBT mode was used. We operated the SBT mode during the day from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\nIn the QW mode, the duration of 70%MV and SBT time (25%MV) increased gradually (Figs. and ). Twenty-two days after the introduction of the QW and SBT modes in association with intensive pulmonary rehabilitation, SBT was running almost fully during the daytime. At this time, the expiratory VT was increased to 350 mL from 150 mL upon admission to our hospital. Thereafter, we withdrew the pressure support ventilation during the nighttime 39 days after the introduction of the auto-weaning mode, and the patient's weaning process was completed.","{'visit

The auto adjustment of fraction of inspiratory oxygen or positive end-expiratory pressure is based on the monitored oxygen saturation fraction of hemoglobin with a pulse oximeter (SpO2) []. The QW mode is an optional automated weaning, and progressively reduces the pressure support, monitors for readiness-to-wean criteria, and provides the option to automatically conduct a fully controlled SBT. In the QW mode, when the spontaneous rate is less than the upper limit of the predicted target range, %MV is automatically decreased gradually to the selected level. To facilitate the recovery of VT by means of the loading work on respiratory muscles, we set the level of support to 70%MV for the QW mode. When spontaneous breathing satisfied the pre-determined conditions of oxygenation and ventilation for 1 min, the SBT mode was used. We operated the SBT mode during the day from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\nIn the QW mode, the duration of 70%MV and SBT time (25%MV) increased gradually (Figs. and ). Twenty-two days after the introduction of the QW and SBT modes in association with intensive pulmonary rehabilitation, SBT was running almost fully during the daytime. At this time, the expiratory VT was increased to 350 mL from 150 mL upon admission to our hospital. Thereafter, we withdrew the pressure support ventilation during the nighttime 39 days after the introduction of the auto-weaning mode, and the patient's weaning process was completed.

23535,"A 52-year-old man with a medical history of high blood pressure and gout was referred to our department for oral mucosa burning causing him pain and discomfort. He was an ancient smoker and reported the sensation of headache with notorious dizziness on two occasions recently. The extraoral examination showed slight facial erythrosis (). Intraoral examination showed slightly hyperkeratotic erythematous lesions located on the inner side of the labial mucosa (). They were pruriginous and painful causing the symptomatology of the patient. The inner sides of the cheeks showed erythematous erosions especially on the right side (). We noticed also two erosive ulcerations as well as hyperkeratotic lesions at the right lateral edge and the ventral side of the tongue forming a discrete reticular network ().\nIn front of these signs, we suspected oral lichen planus associated with candidiasis infection. Mycological examination confirmed candidiasis, and initial treatment consisted of topical mouthwashes with Amphotericin B (50 mg; 5 ml 3 times per day) and Chlorhexidine (0.12%; 3 times per day). Biological tests were requested and a biopsy was scheduled a week after. Two biopsies were performed at the inner side of the lower lip and the right lateral edge of the tongue. The result was oral lichen planus ().\nAlmost all the biological tests (VS, CRP, glycated hemoglobin, and thyroid checkup) were within the normal levels, and serologies (hepatitis and VIH) were negative. However, the complete blood count was unusually marked by an increase in the number of red blood cells, hematocrit, and hemoglobin reaching a value of 19 (). This fortuitous finding led us to suspect polycythemia vera and to refer our patient to the department of hematology where he has undergone an emergency phlebotomy. Two days later, he was a victim of a myocardial infraction. He was hospitalized in the cardiology department where he was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, stented, and put under two platelet aggregation inhibitors: Clopidogrel (Plavix) and Acetylsalicylic acid (Kardégic).\nThe patient was a candidate for a genetic test looking for the JAK-2(V617F) mutation. The absence of this latter made it possible to rule out the diagnosis of Vasquez's primary polycythemia. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level was high (109 mIU/mL). Bone marrow biopsy was not realized due to bleeding risk. The final diagnosis was secondary polycythemia due to chronic hypoxia.\nThe treatment plan was multidisciplinary. In the hematology department, management of polycythemia with hydroxyurea and allopurinol drugs resulted in a durable remission of the myeloproliferative disorder without toxic side effects and a notable regression in the oral pain. There was an appearance of some pigmented oral lesions possibly related to use of hydroxyurea.

79614,"A 40-year-old woman was referred to The Orthopaedic Oncology Center with a chief complaint of ""pain in my left calf for the past ten years."" She reported that her symptoms of pain in her calf began approximately 10 years ago. She described the pain initially as throbbing in nature that was exacerbated with activity and with ankle dorsiflexion and was relieved with rest and warm compresses. At that time, she noted a mass in her left calf that was about 2 inches in size, which did not fluctuate in size and was nontender. She continued to have mild to moderate pain on a regular basis but did not seek medical attention. Instead, she avoided prolonged walking. Approximately three years ago, the pain became more constant and severe. She began walking with a limp due to the inability to dorsiflex her foot to neutral position and she walked on the tip toes of her left foot. For the past 3 years, she has only been able to walk on her tip toes due to an equinus contracture. Three months prior to presentation, in our office, the patient experienced an acute exacerbation of pain in her left calf and sought medical attention from her primary physician. She was prescribed narcotic analgesia without significant relief of her symptoms. The patient was subsequently referred for an MRI. As initial work-up for this lesion, she had an MRI of the left lower extremity.\nThis showed an ovoid mass centered in the soleus muscle measuring 6.8 cm in the craniocaudal dimension, 5.2 cm in the transverse oblique dimension, and 4.6 cm in the oblique dimension. Edema in the soleus muscle and surrounding musculature were noted ().\nFollowing the MRI, she was referred to the orthopaedic oncology service. She believed that the mass had increased slightly from the time she first noticed it 10 years earlier. She had no other associated symptoms. Her past medical history included only a previous hysterectomy with tubal ligation and unilateral oophorectomy and gastroesophageal reflux. She had no history of prior radiation therapy. The only medication she was taking was low dose narcotics for her pain. Her only allergy was a rash to nitrofurantoin. She was married and denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drug use. She had no family history of sarcomas, only a grandmother with non-small cell lung cancer and a paternal aunt and uncle with adenocarcinoma of the colon and an aunt with uterine cancer. Her physical exam revealed an equinus contracture of 20 degrees with plantar flexion from 20–30 degrees of the left ankle. There was a well-defined, firm, and tender deep-seated 5 × 5 cm soft tissue mass in the midcalf. There were no cutaneous changes or skin discoloration or lymphadenopathy. The mass did not change in size when the extremity was elevated or placed in a dependent position. Though this lesion was suspected to be a benign cavernous hemangioma, due to the patient's significant symptoms, she elected for the resection of her left lower extremity soft tissue tumor.\nAt the time of surgery, a longitudinal incision along the posteromedial aspect of the left leg was made. The plane between the gastrocnemius and soleus was developed and the mass was easily identified. Grossly, there was an irregular red-brown to tan-appearing friable mass intertwined with skeletal muscle with associated large vascular channels consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. Manipulation of the ankle under anesthesia was performed bringing the ankle to 10 degrees of dorsiflexion in order to correct the equinus contracture. She was placed in an ankle dorsiflexion splint postoperatively.","{'visit motivation': 'Pain in left calf for the past ten years', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Evaluation of left calf pain and mass', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'The Orthopaedic Oncology Center'}], 'patient information': {'age': '40', 'sex': 'Woman', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Previous hysterectomy with tubal ligation and unilateral ooph', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Not specified', 'Type': 'Hysterectomy with tubal ligation', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Pain in left calf', 'intensity of symptom': 'Mild to moderate, becoming more constant and severe three years ago', 'location': 'Left calf', 'time': 'Began approximately 10 years ago', 'temporalisation': 'Exacerbated with activity and ankle dorsiflexion, relieved with rest and warm compresses', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Pain exacerbated with activity and ankle dorsiflexion', 'details': 'Presence of a mass in left calf, equinus contracture leading to walking on tip toes for the past 3 years'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'None', 'details': 'Mass in left calf about 2 inches in size, nontender'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'MRI of the left lower extremity', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Ovoid mass centered in the soleus muscle measuring 6.8 cm x 5.2 cm x 4.6 cm with edema in the soleus muscle and surrounding musculature', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'Initial work-up for this lesion', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Narcotic analgesia', 'related condition': 'Pain in left calf', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Three months prior to presentation', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To relieve symptoms of pain in left calf', 'reaction to treatment': 'Without significant relief of symptoms', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['How long did the patient receive the treatment?', 'Did the patient experience any side effects or reactions to the treatment?', 'How often was the medication or treatment administered?', 'What was the dosage of the medication or treatment?', 'What specific condition was the treatment intended to address?', 'What medication or treatment was administered?', 'When was the treatment initiated?', 'Are there any additional details mentioned about the treatment (e.g., route of administration, specific instructions)?', 'Why was this treatment initiated?'], ['Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?', 'What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?']]",Treatments,Medical Examinations,"

She had no family history of sarcomas, only a grandmother with non-small cell lung cancer and a paternal aunt and uncle with adenocarcinoma of the colon and an aunt with uterine cancer. Her physical exam revealed an equinus contracture of 20 degrees with plantar flexion from 20–30 degrees of the left ankle. There was a well-defined, firm, and tender deep-seated 5 × 5 cm soft tissue mass in the midcalf. There were no cutaneous changes or skin discoloration or lymphadenopathy. The mass did not change in size when the extremity was elevated or placed in a dependent position. Though this lesion was suspected to be a benign cavernous hemangioma, due to the patient's significant symptoms, she elected for the resection of her left lower extremity soft tissue tumor.\nAt the time of surgery, a longitudinal incision along the posteromedial aspect of the left leg was made. The plane between the gastrocnemius and soleus was developed and the mass was easily identified. Grossly, there was an irregular red-brown to tan-appearing friable mass intertwined with skeletal muscle with associated large vascular channels consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. Manipulation of the ankle under anesthesia was performed bringing the ankle to 10 degrees of dorsiflexion in order to correct the equinus contracture. She was placed in an ankle dorsiflexion splint postoperatively.

119200,"A 60-year-old man with AF was admitted to our hospital after experiencing dyspnea, orthopnea, and a non-productive cough for 2 weeks. The patient had a 10-year history of longstanding persistent AF, four previous radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures (10, 9, and 2 years, and 5 months prior to admission), and a strong family history of AF with ischemic stroke. His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 0 (male, age <60 years old, and no congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism, or vascular disease), and highly symptomatic paroxysmal AF remained after multiple procedures. Although this patient had undergone his 1st and 2nd procedures at another institute and we have limited information based on the medical record, he did show arrhythmogenic PV triggers from the left upper PV. At the 3rd procedure, we had found reconnected PV potentials at the left superior PV and right inferior PV and noted persistence of AF triggers from the left superior PV. Therefore, we had conducted complete circumferential PV isolation and added linear ablations. However, AF recurred as paroxysmal type. At the 4th procedure, all PV isolations and bidirectional blocks of linear ablation were maintained well, and a complex fractionated atrial electrogram-guided ablation was added (). Although a left upper PV trigger occurred during the first three procedures, we did not confirm the exit block by inside PV pacing at the last procedure. To exclude potential epicardial conduction after circumferential PV isolation, inside PV pacing with maximal electrode contact might be important, especially during repeat procedures. There was no evidence of non-PV triggers after electrical cardioversion under isoproterenol infusion. At that time, 75% luminal narrowing of the left superior PV was noticed, but there were no respiratory symptoms. However, the patient became symptomatic with AF recurrence 5 months later, and 3-dimensional-computed tomography (CT) revealed progression of PV stenosis with a significantly atrophied left atrium (). An increased left superior PV systolic peak flow velocity (251 cm/s) with turbulent flow at the PV ostium was observed on the transesophageal echocardiogram (). Based on the diagnosis of clinically significant left superior PV stenosis (), balloon-expandable stent deployment (10×19 mm, OMNILINK, Abbott Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) after balloon angioplasty (8×20 mm, POWERFLEX, Cordis Inc., Hialeah, FL, USA) () was performed. Sinus rhythm was restored, and the patient exhibited no apparent symptoms related to PV stenosis or AF recurrence 1 day after PV stenting. A follow-up CT performed 12 months after the procedure showed a patent left superior PV ().

178441,"A one month old baby girl was brought by her mother to the lactation clinic for further evaluation due to the difficulty of breastfeeding. The mother complained of pain in the nipple which was present throughout the entire breastfeeding session and usually recurred with each episode of breastfeeding. Two weeks after delivery, the mother noticed a tooth on the baby's lower left gum. A week later, she noticed an ulcer under her baby's tongue, which occasionally bled.\nIn light of the continuous pain during breastfeeding, the mother became reluctant to continue and infant formula milk was given as a substitute. Self-examination by the mother did not reveal any nipple crack or breast injury. Her antenatal history was uneventful. There was strong family history of natal teeth, and this baby's siblings had similar problems.\nOn examination, the mother's breast appeared to be normal and consistent with a lactating breast. There was no inflammation or engorgement. Some mild eczema was noted around the nipple, but there was no infection. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes were not palpable.\nExamination of the oral cavity of the baby revealed a neonatal tooth over the left anterior region of the mandibular ridge. The tooth measured 2 mm × 1 mm in size, was whitish opaque, and had Grade II mobility (Fig. ). There was also a whitish ulcer over the ventral aspect of the tongue measuring 1 mm × 1 mm (Fig. ). The parents declined radiological investigations and tongue biopsy for the baby. Hence, the clinical diagnosis was neonatal tooth associated with Riga-Fede disease causing difficulty in breastfeeding.\nThe baby was then referred to the pediatric dental surgery department. After a thorough discussion with the parents, the neonatal tooth was extracted under local anesthesia. The tooth had a crown but lacked a root. Following extraction, the baby did not have any complication such as bleeding and infection. The wound healed well within 2 days and she successfully resumed taking breast feeds.\nCurrently, at 10 months post-extraction, the child is growing well and still breastfeeding.

76707,"A healthy 32-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to emergency room with acute diffuse abdominal and pelvic pain, started 4 hours previously, at 25 weeks of pregnancy. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy. She had no reported history of endometriosis and previous abdominal surgery. Physical examination led to a diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis. Upon admission, temperature was 37.7°C and blood pressure was 110/62 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 18.500/mL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 4.02 mg/dL (normal, 0.2 mg/dL). Abdominal ultrasound revealed minimal fluid around the liver, but neither air nor gross fluid was visible in the abdominal cavity. The obstetric evaluation ruled out an obstetric aetiology of patient's symptoms. The patient underwent an emergency operation for a presumptive diagnosis of acute diffuse peritonitis. Explorative laparoscopy was useful to confirm the clinical suspicion and revealed diffuse severe purulent peritonitis that originated from a double rectal and sigmoid perforation <1 cm in diameter related to an endometriotic nodule, that was confirmed in histopathological findings. A previous adherence, caused by endometriotic nodule, and the progressive traction of the enlarged uterus on the strictly adherent sigmoid colon could be a possible aetiopathogenetic mechanism. The surgical approach, for reduced intraperitoneal operative space, was continued through a median laparotomy. Purulent fluid was found in the abdominal cavity, and with further investigation a left sided sigmoid perforation was found associated with another perforation in rectosigmoid junction that was closed with linear stapler and sigmoid in site of perforation was chosen as stoma in left lateral abdominal wall. The patient tolerated the procedure well (). The fetal status remained satisfactory and the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus faecalis were detected in the intraperitoneal fluid culture. Patient was treated with Meropenem 1 gr i.v. every 8 hours for 10 days and she was discharged on postoperative day 12 without any other complications.

A healthy 32-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to emergency room with acute diffuse abdominal and pelvic pain, started 4 hours previously, at 25 weeks of pregnancy. She had an uncomplicated pregnancy. She had no reported history of endometriosis and previous abdominal surgery. Physical examination led to a diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis. Upon admission, temperature was 37.7°C and blood pressure was 110/62 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 18.500/mL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 4.02 mg/dL (normal, 0.2 mg/dL). Abdominal ultrasound revealed minimal fluid around the liver, but neither air nor gross fluid was visible in the abdominal cavity. The obstetric evaluation ruled out an obstetric aetiology of patient's symptoms. The patient underwent an emergency operation for a presumptive diagnosis of acute diffuse peritonitis. Explorative laparoscopy was useful to confirm the clinical suspicion and revealed diffuse severe purulent peritonitis that originated from a double rectal and sigmoid perforation <1 cm in diameter related to an endometriotic nodule, that was confirmed in histopathological findings. A previous adherence, caused by endometriotic nodule, and the progressive traction of the enlarged uterus on the strictly adherent sigmoid colon could be a possible aetiopathogenetic mechanism. The surgical approach, for reduced intraperitoneal operative space, was continued through a median laparotomy. Purulent fluid was found in the abdominal cavity, and with further investigation a left sided sigmoid perforation was found associated with another perforation in rectosigmoid junction that was closed with linear stapler and sigmoid in site of perforation was chosen as stoma in left lateral abdominal wall. The patient tolerated the procedure well (). The fetal status remained satisfactory and the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus faecalis were detected in the intraperitoneal fluid culture. Patient was treated with Meropenem 1 gr i.v. every 8 hours for 10 days and she was discharged on postoperative day 12 without any other complications. Physiological fetal growth and an uneventful antenatal period were reported until 41 weeks of gestation when a cesarean section was performed for unsuccessful vaginal delivery induction. The patient delivered a healthy female baby weighing 3750 gr with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at one and five minutes, respectively. Colostomy was closed after 3 months without any complications.

169627,"In 2010 a 75 year-old female patient presented at our clinic with a 2-year history of pain and recent emergence of a discharging sinus at her left upper leg. She had a history of bilateral gonarthrosis and underwent elective right and left knee total arthroplasty 5 years before. The procedures and the post-operative follow-up were uneventful. Her physical examination revealed slight swelling and tenderness with a mild seropurulent discharge on the antero-lateral aspect on her proximal left leg. There was no other systemic complaint. Her personal and family histories were unrevealing. There was no history of fever, trauma, previous tuberculosis or bone tumors. Lower limb x-rays were performed and the radiographic examination revealed a well demarcated cystic structure in her left tibia, 4 cm below the distal tibial component of the knee arthroplasty (). A purulent sample was collected and sent for microbiological study, after which, to better investigate the nature of the cyst, an incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed, and the sample subjected to histopathologic examination. The laboratory study isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and appropriate antibiotics where then administered according to the susceptibility test carried out. Pathology results revealed hydatid cyst of the tibia. Segmental resection was planned, and the surgical approach revealed a diaphyseal cyst adherent to the surrounding tissues, which were markedly oedematous, with multiple membranous whitish tissues in aggregation. Fluid was aspirated from the cyst, and the sample was sent for microbiology and serology tests. After curettage of the lesion and power-pulse lavage, povidone-iodine-alcohol solution was injected. Due to the fragility of the remaining tibial diaphysis, an external fixator was applied. Microscopy confirmed the diagnosis and revealed osseous tissue with hyaline and germinative membranes, lymphocytes, and monocytes.\nAlbendazole and praziquantel, antihelminthic drugs, at doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg, respectively, were started. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged shortly after the procedure. She was clinically and radiologically evaluated in the following months, revealing progressive bone growth, remodeling and consolidation, having the external fixator extracted 6 months after the initial procedure.\nThe patient then remained exempt of pain, swelling or other complications, until May 2014, when suddenly she comes to our clinic, complaining of pain and unable to bear weight on her left knee.\nX-ray studies revealed a pathologic periprosthetic fracture, below the tibial component, resulting from an extension of the previously treated hydatic cyst (). A treatment plan was performed, and our patient underwent surgical intervention. Both of the total knee arthoplasty components exhibited signs of loosening (), and after extraction of them, a total revision knee arthroplasty was performed ().

In 2010 a 75 year-old female patient presented at our clinic with a 2-year history of pain and recent emergence of a discharging sinus at her left upper leg. She had a history of bilateral gonarthrosis and underwent elective right and left knee total arthroplasty 5 years before. The procedures and the post-operative follow-up were uneventful. Her physical examination revealed slight swelling and tenderness with a mild seropurulent discharge on the antero-lateral aspect on her proximal left leg. There was no other systemic complaint. Her personal and family histories were unrevealing. There was no history of fever, trauma, previous tuberculosis or bone tumors. Lower limb x-rays were performed and the radiographic examination revealed a well demarcated cystic structure in her left tibia, 4 cm below the distal tibial component of the knee arthroplasty (). A purulent sample was collected and sent for microbiological study, after which, to better investigate the nature of the cyst, an incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed, and the sample subjected to histopathologic examination. The laboratory study isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and appropriate antibiotics where then administered according to the susceptibility test carried out. Pathology results revealed hydatid cyst of the tibia. Segmental resection was planned, and the surgical approach revealed a diaphyseal cyst adherent to the surrounding tissues, which were markedly oedematous, with multiple membranous whitish tissues in aggregation. Fluid was aspirated from the cyst, and the sample was sent for microbiology and serology tests. After curettage of the lesion and power-pulse lavage, povidone-iodine-alcohol solution was injected. Due to the fragility of the remaining tibial diaphysis, an external fixator was applied. Microscopy confirmed the diagnosis and revealed osseous tissue with hyaline and germinative membranes, lymphocytes, and monocytes.\nAlbendazole and praziquantel, antihelminthic drugs, at doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg, respectively, were started. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged shortly after the procedure. She was clinically and radiologically evaluated in the following months, revealing progressive bone growth, remodeling and consolidation, having the external fixator extracted 6 months after the initial procedure.\nThe patient then remained exempt of pain, swelling or other complications, until May 2014, when suddenly she comes to our clinic, complaining of pain and unable to bear weight on her left knee.\nX-ray studies revealed a pathologic periprosthetic fracture, below the tibial component, resulting from an extension of the previously treated hydatic cyst (). A treatment plan was performed, and our patient underwent surgical intervention. Both of the total knee arthoplasty components exhibited signs of loosening (), and after extraction of them, a total revision knee arthroplasty was performed (). The cancellous bone loss in the tibial component was considerable, and this defect was addressed by autologous bone graft implemention around the tibial stem and plateau. The patient functional outcome was excellent. She recovered motility of her left knee, and now more than 24 months has passed and she is fully weight bearing with no pain, knee instability or discomfort.

31978,"A 71-year-old man presented to our movement disorder clinic for concerning symptoms. Before presenting to the clinic, he was diagnosed with CD four years ago. He mentioned that he had progressive tremor and rigidity of the head. The rigidity was not new but has gotten worse. However, the tremor in the head was new and appeared approximately six months ago. The patient described that his head moved to the right unintentionally, and he always needed to stop it by putting his left hand on his chin, which was very annoying to him. He mentioned that this happened more commonly during the day while he was reading or eating dinner. Additionally, he described that in the last year he started to developed daytime sleepiness, overnight awakenings, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, occasional shoulder pain, and loss of smell.\nOn initial examination, the first mini-mental exam (MMSE) was 30/30. Cranial nerves were intact except for the subjective reduced smell. The superficial sensation was normal. The motor exam showed reflexes 2+. The head's tremor was noted while the patient was sitting and looking straight, and limitations of the cervical range of motion, including flexion, rotation, and extension. The gait was normal, without exhibiting any balance issues. The muscle tone was normal except in the neck, which was clearly increased. Motor strength was 5/5 in all four extremities. Upon palpation on the neck, there was tenderness of sternocleidomastoid and scale muscles but without inflammation signs. The patient was treated with botulinum toxin A injections and continued the same treatment every six months.\nHis family history was unremarkable. In particular, he had no family history of movement disorders or any neurological disorder. Personal medical history included hypotension, mild bilateral neurosensorial hearing loss, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The patient had a cholecystectomy 20 years ago due to gallstones.\nThe patient continued with routine visits to the office every six months. Three years after the first visit, the patient started to have problems with his balance and also described trouble getting out of bed in the morning due to a feeling that his whole body was ""frozen."" The patient reported difficulty negotiating curbs and demonstrated difficulty with multitasking while walking. The patient said that he played golf about four times per week without problem except walking on the grass and stabilizing himself after getting out of the golf cart. The patient did not report any major falls. He also mentioned falling when rising suddenly from a sitting position. He continued having intermittent hypotension readings upon his general practitioner's examination and orthostatic hypotension episodes when examined in the movement disorder clinic.\nUpon examination, he continued having the same CD signs, with increased rigidity and tenderness of the neck, but the neck's tremor was improving. The muscle tone was increased, slightly more on the right side of the body. The sensation was normal. When walking, he had decreased swinging of the arms and difficulty turning back. He exhibited decreased amplitude in the upper extremities' movements (bradykinesia), increasing rigidity in the upper and lower extremities. He denied having hallucinations or memory problems. We performed an MRI to rule out any structural damage. The MRI was completely normal. The symptoms and signs of the patient make us diagnosed the patient with PD.\nInitial genetic testing for glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LARRK-2) genes was negative, and the extended gene panel, including the parkin gene, is pending. We performed these tests in the movement disorder clinic for research purposes and established a patient's genetic database. We acknowledge that these genetic tests are not routinely performed or necessary for diagnosing PD. The patient began treatment with levodopa-carbidopa. Over the next few days, the patient reported an initial strong response and improved his bradykinesia symptoms. The shaking in the head also improved.\nRemarkably, months later, the patient reported that the symptoms associated with his CD start to improve dramatically. One year later, after initiating the treatment with levodopa-carbidopa, the patient reported no longer having CD symptoms. Physical exam was also negative for CD signs. Today, the patient is 86 years old and no longer requires botulinum injections. However, his PD symptoms have gotten worse. He has rigidity in the upper and lower extremities, decreased speed and amplitude in his movements, and decreased motor strength of 4/5 in the upper extremities and lower extremities. The rigidity appears to be worst on the right side of his body. He has fallen two times in the last year, luckily without any fractures. The patient is retired and still functional in his daily activities. However, his finances are managed by his wife. The spouse sleeps in a different bed because of the patient's constant movement while sleeping, which is related to his rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder. His symptoms are managed today with a long-acting L-Dopa 5 and a short-acting L-Dopa inhaler used for his ""off episodes"".","{'visit motivation': 'Concerning symptoms related to movement disorder', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Movement disorder clinic'}], 'patient information': {'age': '71', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'Unremarkable, no family history of movement disorders or any neurological disorder', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Hypotension, mild bilateral neurosensorial hearing loss, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Gallstones', 'Type': 'Cholecystectomy', 'time': '20 years ago', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Progressive tremor and rigidity of the head', 'intensity of symptom': 'Rigidity not new but worsened, tremor new', 'location': 'Head', 'time': 'Rigidity present for four years, tremor for approximately six months', 'temporalisation': 'More commonly during the day', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Occurs while reading or eating dinner', 'details': 'Head moves to the right unintentionally, stopped by putting left hand on chin'}, {'name of symptom': 'Daytime sleepiness, overnight awakenings, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, occasional shoulder pain, and loss of smell', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'Started in the last year', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Mini-mental exam (MMSE)', 'result': '30/30', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Cranial nerves examination', 'result': 'Intact except for subjective reduced smell', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Superficial sensation examination', 'result': 'Normal', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Motor exam', 'result': 'Reflexes 2+, muscle tone normal except neck, motor strength 5/5 in all four extremities', 'details': 'Increased muscle tone in neck'}, {'name': 'Palpation on the neck', 'result': 'Tenderness of sternocleidomastoid and scale muscles', 'details': 'No signs of inflammation'}, {'name': 'Gait examination', 'result': 'Normal', 'details': 'No balance issues'}, {'name': 'Cervical range of motion examination', 'result': 'Limitations in flexion, rotation, and extension', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Botulinum toxin A injections', 'related condition': 'Movement disorder symptoms', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'Every six months', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To treat symptoms', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'Routine visits to the office every six', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What type of surgery was performed?', 'When was the surgery performed?', 'What was the reason for the surgery?', 'What was the outcome of the surgery (e.g., successful, complications)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the surgical procedure or complications?'], ['What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?']]",Surgeries,Medical Examinations,"

She had leukocytosis (WBCs 18,000 N 69%), and abdominal ultrasound showed a non specific abdominal mass on the right side. A laparotomy was done for suspicion of an appendicular mass. The mass was not excised but a biopsy and culture were taken and a drain left in place. Her fever and abdominal pain persisted postoperatively with new onset of vomiting.\nOn arrival to our hospital she was still in pain and febrile (38.5-39°C). She was irritable with right sided abdominal tenderness. Her labs showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia (WBCs 14.600, N 76.2%, L 17.3%), ESR 38, kidney and liver function tests were within normal. Abdominal X-ray showed a right sided mass with calcifications (Figure ). Abdominal CT scan confirmed an intraabdominal mass on the right side below the transverse colon, with calcified walls and characteristics compatible with inflammatory fatty tissue (Figure ). Intravenous pyelography revealed no relation to the right kidney (Figure ). She was initially managed conservatively with IV fluids, antibiotics and bowel rest. She improved clinically, fever and pain subsided and inflammatory markers decreased. She was discharged home with close follow up of the mass. Twenty days later, the mass had increased in size, so she underwent an exploratory laparotomy. The intraperitoneal (10 × 7 cm) mass was found to be hypervascularized with significant adhesions to the surrounding bowel and the omentum covering it. The mass was resected without complications. The patient improved and all her symptoms resolved. Pathology showed fibroadipose tissue displaying areas of adiponecrosis, foci of mixed inflammatory infiltrate, and proliferation of bundle forming fibroblasts consistent with mesenteric panniculitis

159158,"A 47-year old male presented to the specialist outpatient clinic at a tertiary university hospital after being referred from a general practitioner, with an initial diagnosis of a Baker's cyst of his right knee. The patient presented with a one-year history of localized pain over theposterior aspect of his right knee. The pain had been recurrent over the last year and was particularly exacerbated with squatting. There were recurrent episodes of swelling noted over the last 8 months associated with intermittent locking of the knee joint. The patient had no previous trauma to the knee and did not engage in sports regularly. On examination, there was a discrete 4cm diameter hemispherical cystic mass at the popliteal region of the patient's right knee. The mass was fluctuant, firm and cystic on palpation. It was tender and immobile and was also more apparent on extension of the knee. No joint effusion was noted but medial joint line tenderness, particularly over the posterior horn of the medial meniscus, was elicited. Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees passively, but terminal flexion was uncomfortable. There was no ligamentous instability. McMurray's test was negative. Radiographic images of both knees did not reveal any abnormalities.\nMRI scans of the right knee demonstrated a complex multidirectional tear involving the posterior horn and posterior junction of the medial meniscus, with an oblique component extending to the superior and inferior articular surfaces. A horizontal tear through the posterior horn extending postero-medially was also identified (Figs. , ). The MRI also showed a complex multilobulated, multiseptated intra-articular cystic lesion abutting the posterior margin of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. The cyst also extended to the intercondylar region, abutting the posterior margin of the posterior cruciate ligament. The cyst was found to communicate with a defect\nalong the posterior margin of the posterior horn of the meniscal tear. The cyst measured to be 3.8 X 2.5 (axial dimension) X 3.0 cm (craniocaudal dimension). Another smaller, elongated, septated cystic complex was identified extending supero-medially adjacent to the medial femoral condyle, posterior to the medial collateral ligament. Thissmaller component measured 1.5 X 0.4 (axial dimension) X 1.7 cm (craniocaudal dimension). The lateral meniscus was intact and normal in configuration. No significant articular cartilage defect or bone contusion was seen and no ligamentous abnormalities were noted (Fig. ).\nThe patient was diagnosed to have a complex degenerative tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus associated with a large multiloculated, parameniscal cyst. He was then scheduled for arthroscopic surgery.\nDiagnostic arthroscopic examination of the knee was performed using standard anterolateral and anteromedial portals. Arthroscopy revealed a small tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus and a large perilabral cyst (Fig. ). The cyst was punctured and aspirated using a long 10G needle under direct visualization at arthroscopy (Figs. , ). The cystic material was subsequently sent for cytology as well as histology. Following this, the remaining sac was debrided with a motorized shaver. Histological analysis of the gelatinous fluid revealed blood clots, macrophages and fibrinous material, with no malignancy identified. Post-operative recovery was very satisfactory and remarkable.\nThe patient was reviewed 24 months post-surgery. There were no signs of recurrence and the patient did not experience any pain, instability or locking of the knee. He was able to lead an active lifestyle.","{'visit motivation': 'Localized pain over the posterior aspect of the right knee, recurrent swelling, and intermittent locking of the knee joint.', 'admission': [{'reason': ""Initial diagnosis of a Baker's cyst of his right knee"", 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Specialist outpatient clinic at a tertiary university hospital'}], 'patient information': {'age': '47', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'No previous trauma to the knee, does not engage in sports regularly', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'Not regular', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Localized pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Posterior aspect of the right knee', 'time': 'One-year history, recurrent over the last year', 'temporalisation': 'Exacerbated with squatting', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Squatting', 'details': 'Recurrent episodes of swelling over the last 8 months, intermittent locking of the knee joint'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': ""Discrete 4cm diameter hemispherical cystic mass at the popliteal region of the right knee, firm and cystic on palpation, tender and immobile, more apparent on extension of the knee, no joint effusion, medial joint line tenderness, range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees passively, terminal flexion uncomfortable, no ligamentous instability, McMurray's test negative"", 'details': 'Mass was fluctuant'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Radiographic images', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'No abnormalities', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Images of both knees'}, {'test': 'MRI scans', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Complex multidirectional tear involving the posterior horn and posterior junction of the medial meniscus, with an oblique component extending to the superior and inferior articular surfaces.

175713,"A 21-year-old healthy nulliparous female presented to a regional hospital in Australia in spontaneous labour at 39 weeks and 4 days of gestation. Her pregnancy was otherwise uncomplicated and she had no medical and surgical history of note.\nThe patient presented to the hospital with a cervical dilation of 4 cm. Her first stage of labour lasted 1 hr and 45 minutes and her second stage lasted 1 hr and 16 minutes, respectively. Analgesic treatment in the first stage included nitrogen oxide as required and 10 mg of intramuscular morphine. Analgesic used in the second stage was only nitrous oxide as required. An episiotomy was performed at delivery. She delivered a live born infant weighing 3690 g with APGAR scores of 9 and 10. The 3rd stage lasted 15 minutes with delivery of an intact placenta.\nAfter delivery, she further requested nitrous oxide and had 10 mls of 1.0% lignocaine infiltrated into the perineum for an episiotomy repair.\nApproximately 2 hours postpartum, the patient started complaining of sudden onset dyspnea and lower chest tightness. Her GCS was 15 at this time and her vital signs were oxygen saturation >95% on room air with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, pulse of 85 beats per minute, BP 130/78, and a temperature 37.2°C.\nPhysical examination at the time revealed swelling in the neck and jaw line and palpable crepitus in the anterior chest wall, neck, and jaw, consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.\nInitial management included observation and pulse oximetry, as she was clinically stable and able to have a conversation without increase in chest pain or decrease in oxygen saturation.\nSubsequently a chest X-ray (CXR) was obtained which demonstrated pneumomediastinum with air tracking superiorly into the pericardiac spaces (). Following telephone consultation with a cardiothoracic team at our major tertiary referral center, a computed tomography (CT) contrast study was ordered as recommended. CT contrast reconfirmed pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema and ruled out esophageal injury (). It also demonstrated extension of air in the cervical region ().\nThe findings were once again discussed with the cardiothoracic team who advised expectant management due to the stability of the patient's clinical state.\nHer postnatal course was uncomplicated thereafter and she only requested routine oral postpartum analgesia such as Panadol and Ibuprofen. Subcutaneous crepitus receded and became minimal by postpartum day 2 for the remainder of her hospital stay. She remained clinically stable and all observations were within normal limits. She was observed for 48 hours postpartum and was discharged on day 2 with the extended midwifery service. A repeat CXR done 2 weeks postpartum was normal and showed resolution of all findings ().","{'visit motivation': 'Spontaneous labour', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Labour and delivery', 'date': '39 weeks

23053,"A 28-year-old male came to our Emergency Department with vision loss in his right eye following an accident that occurred an hour earlier at his workplace. The patient is a farmer who plans to hunt eels in rice fields. He was using a 4.5mm air rifle with projectiles consisting of metal arrows made from motorcycle wheel spokes. When the gun jammed, he checked it through the gun barrel, and the accident happened when the rifle was accidentally triggered. A metal arrow entered his head and penetrated his right infraorbital region.\nOn arrival, his vital signs were normal limit and his mental status was alert. Primary and secondary surveys did not reveal additional injuries, and no significant medical history or drugs, tobacco, or alcohol abuse was recorded. The patient reported having a headache but no nausea, vomiting, or convulsions. In addition, he exhibited normal body temperature, a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 points, clear consciousness and speech, and cooperation during the physical examination. The muscular strength and tension of the limbs were normal. Bilateral Babinski signs were not induced. He was given a preoperative test immediately after admission, as well as an intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic, anti-tetanus injection, and anti-convulsant medications. Blood analyses and other biochemical parameters were within normal limits.\nLocal examination revealed a perforating injury at the entry location of the foreign body and penetration below the right infraorbital margin measuring 0.5 × 0.5 cm in size with bleeding (A). His right pupil was dilated and not reactive to light, and eye movement was limited. Only minimal ecchymosis and hyphemia were seen in the anterior chamber of the right eye. There was a penetrating wound on the right inferior medial eyelid or Zone 3C of the Turbin pattern measuring 1 × 0.5 cm (B). Using a slit lamp, we found a vitreous hemorrhage (C), and ocular ultrasound revealed a discontinuity of the inferior wall of the eyeball (A).\nA plain skull radiograph showed that a metallic foreign body that looked like an arrow had penetrated above the right orbital roof (B). The tip of the foreign object was in the right parietal lobe as revealed by non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) (C) and a three-dimensional CT (3D CT) of his brain (A). No lesions of the major cerebral vessels were noted on non-contrast CT angiography (CTA) (B).\nAs there was no evidence of vascular injury and the neurosurgeon recommended anterior orbital rather than transcranial surgery, it was considered reasonable and safe to remove the foreign body anteriorly. Subsequently, with preparing and planning surgery having established a multidisciplinary approached, the patient was transferred to the operating room 2 h after arriving in the Emergency Department. We (the neurosurgeon and ophthalmologist) performed retrograde removal through the penetration wound with C-arm radiography fluoroscopic guidance (C). We used fluoroscopic guidance during the surgery to determine the precise location of the base of the arrow through the penetration or entrance wound and to perform retrograde removal gently. There was a minimal amount of brain tissue accompanying the arrow from the entry wound without CSF leakage. The length of the homemade metal arrow was 10 cm (D). Following this procedure, we irrigated the wound with a standard 0.9% saline solution containing antibiotics to eliminate debris and control bleeding in the entrance wound and wound track as far as could be attained.\nPost-surgery, the patient was admitted to the critical care unit, where broad-spectrum antibiotics and anticonvulsant drugs were administered for seven days. His intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored by the neurosurgeon in the postoperative period for two days and was within normal limits. The patient fully recovered and was discharged on postoperative day 10. The long-term, post-operative evaluation six months later, as well as the surgical wound and the patient's general condition, were satisfactory. The CT brain scan with and without contrast showed a slight ischemia on the right-frontal lobe and a globe rupture on the right eye (A). The CTA detected no abnormal vascular brain structure (B). Meanwhile, the patient's vision had not changed, with enophthalmus in the right eye (C).","{'visit motivation': 'Vision loss in his right eye following an accident at his workplace', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Accident involving a metal arrow penetrating the right infraorbital region', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Emergency Department'}], 'patient information': {'age': '28', 'sex': 'male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'farmer', 'occupation': 'farmer'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'None', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'no alcohol abuse', 'drug usage': 'no drugs', 'smoking status': 'no tobacco abuse'}, 'surgeries': [], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'headache', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'head', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'The patient reported having a headache but no nausea, vomiting, or convulsions.'}, {'name of symptom': 'vision loss', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'right eye', 'time': 'an hour earlier', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'accident at workplace', 'details': 'A metal arrow entered his head and penetrated his right infraorbital region.'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Primary and secondary surveys', 'result': 'Did not reveal additional injuries', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Mental status examination', 'result': 'Alert', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'result': '15 points', 'details': 'Clear consciousness and speech, and cooperation during the physical examination.'}, {'name': 'Muscular strength and tension examination', 'result': 'Normal', 'details': 'The muscular strength and tension of the limbs were normal.'}, {'name': 'Babinski sign examination', 'result': 'Bilateral Babinski signs were not induced', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Local examination', 'result': 'Perforating injury at the entry location of the foreign body and penetration below the right infraorbital margin measuring 0.5 × 0.5 cm with bleeding (A)', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Eye examination', 'result': 'Right pupil was dilated and not reactive to light, and eye movement was limited', 'details': 'Only minimal ecchymosis and hyphemia were seen in the anterior chamber of the right eye.'}, {'name': 'Eyelid examination', 'result': 'Penetrating wound on the right inferior medial eyelid or Zone 3C of the Turbin pattern measuring 1 × 0.5 cm (B)', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Slit lamp examination', 'result': 'Vitreous hemorrhage (C)', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Ocular ultrasound', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Incomplete information', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Preoperative test', 'related condition': 'Penetrating injury from accident', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Immediately after admission', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Preparation for surgery', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic', 'related condition': 'Prevent infection', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'After admission', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To prevent infection due to the penetrating injury', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Anti-tetanus injection', 'related condition': 'Prevent tetanus', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'After admission', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Due to the nature of the injury and as a precaution', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Anti-convulsant medications', 'related condition': 'Prevent convulsions', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'After admission', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'As a precaution due to the head injury', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['Does the note mention any relevant sexual history details (e.g., sexually transmitted infections)?

7966,"A 67-year-old Caucasian man presented to the emergency room because of a 4 days' history of abdominal pain, with one episode of vomiting.\nThe patient's past medical history was significant for colonic diverticulosis and an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding one year before. The event had been investigated by two different gastroscopies, a colonoscopy and a MDCT, which produced inconclusive results. Ten months later he was newly admitted because of abdominal pain and fever at 38.0 C°, with valid urination and defecation. A CT of the abdomen was performed, which confirmed the colonic diverticulosis and revealed the presence of multiple diverticula of the small intestine, fat stranding, signs of inflammation as well as a small amount of free liquid in the abdomen. The patient was hence diagnosed with jejunal diverticulitis and managed conservatively with intra-venous antibiotics, with an apparent complete recovery.\nHe re-presented to the emergency department two months later with acute abdominal pain. The pain was described as severe and constant, localized mainly in the lower abdomen with clinical signs of peritonitis. No change in bowel habits nor urinary symptoms were complained. His vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C°; he appeared fully oriented and not in any acute distress. Laboratory examination reported a hemoglobin of 121 g/dL, a WBC count of 12.2 × 10E9/L and a CRP of 249 mg/L. Other laboratory data were within normal limit. An abdominal and pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography, with administration of oral contrast, was performed. Jejunum and ileum showed several diverticula as well as an inflammatory thick-walled mass involving different loops of the intestine. In addition, free fluid in the abdomen and a small amount of subdiaphragmatic air were reported (, ). On the basis of these findings, the diagnosis of perforated diverticulitis was hereby proposed.\nThe patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy which revealed plenty of purulent yellowish liquid collected in the right abdomen and a conglomerate of intestinal inflamed loops. We hence decided to convert immediately the procedure to laparotomy. Large multiple diverticula were found covering a section of small intestine approximately 2.5 m long, without signs of obvious macro perforation. Among the middle distal tract of the jejunum and the middle distal tract of ileum, strong adhesions were identified (). The involved segments of jejunum and ileum were connected by an intestinal loop free of signs of diverticulosis (). There were no signs of bowel ischemia. Adhesiolisis was partially carried out, however, because of difficulties associated with the procedure, we opt to perform a double enterectomy, removing only those segments involved in the intestinal conglomerate and deeply affected by the pathology. Roughly 25 cm of ileum and 80 cm of jejunum were resected. Bowel continuity was restored with an ileo-ileal and a jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. Almost 700 cl of pus were drained and the peritoneal cavity was washed with 10 L of saline solution. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged 8 days later. There were no signs of malignancy in the resected intestine.","{'visit motivation': ""4 days' history of abdominal pain, with one episode of vomiting"", 'admission': [{'reason': 'abdominal pain and fever', 'date': 'Ten months after the initial gastrointestinal bleeding event', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '67', 'sex': 'man', 'ethnicity': 'Caucasian', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'colonic diverticulosis, gastrointestinal bleeding one year before, jejunal diverticulitis', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'perforated diverticulitis', 'Type': 'diagnostic laparoscopy', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'revealed plenty of purulent yellowish liquid'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'abdominal pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'severe and constant', 'location': 'mainly in the lower abdomen', 'time': 'presented two months later after previous admission', 'temporalisation': ""4 days' history"", 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'clinical signs of peritonitis'}, {'name of symptom': 'vomiting', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': ""during the 4 days' history of abdominal pain"", 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'one episode'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Laboratory examination', 'result': 'hemoglobin of 121 g/dL, a WBC count of 12.2 × 10E9/L and a CRP of 249 mg/L', 'details': 'Other laboratory data were within normal limit'}, {'name': 'Vital signs', 'result': 'temperature of 37.2 C°; stable vital signs', 'details': 'fully oriented and not in any acute distress'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'CT of the abdomen', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'confirmed the colonic diverticulosis and revealed the presence of multiple diverticula of the small intestine, fat stranding, signs of inflammation as well as a small amount of free liquid in the abdomen', 'condition': 'jejunal diverticulitis', 'time': 'Ten months after the initial gastrointestinal bleeding event', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Abdominal and pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Jejunum and ileum showed several diverticula as well as an inflammatory thick-walled mass involving different loops of the intestine.

Adhesiolisis was partially carried out, however, because of difficulties associated with the procedure, we opt to perform a double enterectomy, removing only those segments involved in the intestinal conglomerate and deeply affected by the pathology. Roughly 25 cm of ileum and 80 cm of jejunum were resected. Bowel continuity was restored with an ileo-ileal and a jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. Almost 700 cl of pus were drained and the peritoneal cavity was washed with 10 L of saline solution. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged 8 days later. There were no signs of malignancy in the resected intestine.

She did not have any cyanosis, palpitations, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea.\nShe was initially evaluated with a nuclear stress test that did not show any reversible ischemia but dilation of the right ventricle (RV); ejection fraction was identified to be 54%. The patient was further evaluated by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in order to evaluate the RV dilatation. TTE identified a complete absence of IAS and a CA (). The findings were confirmed with a positive bubble study (). Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed that confirmed the absence of IAS, demonstrated free mixing of color flow, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, normal mitral valve structure, normal left ventricular ejection fraction, and enlarged right atrium (RA) and RV.\nThe patient was evaluated with cardiac computed tomography angiogram (CCTA) that demonstrated the right coronary artery to be the dominant artery, all coronary arteries to be ectatic/aneurysmal and measuring up to 8-10 mm, a complete absence of IAS, marked dilation of CA and both ventricles, a coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAF) between the distal left anterior descending and coronary sinus, massive dilation of pulmonary arteries, and no mitral or aortic valvular abnormalities; left ventricular ejection fraction was measured to be 59% (Figures –).\nThe patient underwent an invasive angiography (IA) which demonstrated many abnormal findings.

30953,"A 16-year-old boy, after suffering from a falling injury to his right distal tibia, applied home remedies and herbs in an attempt to manage symptoms of swelling and redness. Unfortunately, his skin did not respond well and resulted in the formation of large blisters. He was taken to the local hospital and intravenous antibiotics were given. However, medication was ineffective, and skin around the medial side of right tibia ruptured leaving his bone exposed. He was experiencing repeated rupturing of his wound with purulent discharge that had a foul smell. This later developed to continuous purulent discharge. He was then taken to the local hospital and bacterial culture was done. The results showed Staphylococcus aureus and he was eventually transferred to our hospital.\nAt presentation, his right foot was not weight-bearing. There was scar tissue along the full length of the anteromedial side of the tibia and fixed equinus deformity and stiffness of the right ankle joint (Fig. ). There was a draining sinus anteriorly just 4 cm below the knee joint (Fig. ). On physical examination the right knee flexion was limited to less than 70 degrees, muscles were atrophied, and there was equinus ankle deformity and ankle stiffness. Neurovascular and muscular status of the anterior compartment of the right lower leg was compromised, anterior tibialis was unidentified, dorsal pedis artery was weak compared to the opposite side, right foot lacked sensation on palpation and active dorsiflexion of the foot was completely lost.\nRadiology showed a tibial bone defect of about 80% of the distal length. The remaining proximal tibia showed some loss of cortex and lytic lesion (Fig. ). Fibula showed diffused osteomyelitis in the distal part. Furthermore, the X-ray showed talus bone defect and equinus deformity of the calcaneus (Fig. ).\nLaboratory results from blood work revealed ESR 26(mm/1 h), c-reactive protein 6.83(mg/L) and a slightly increased liver function AST/ALT 1.9(IU/L), otherwise normal. A biopsy was taken from the drainage sinus and culture showed the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was clear that the patient suffered from a severe diffused chronic osteomyelitis of the right tibia according to Cierny-Mader classification type IV class A []. The patient and his parents strongly insisted to focus the treatment on preserving his limb.\nAfter thorough analysis and planning, the patient was scheduled for his first stage of surgery. We started by excision of the infected part of the distal fibula, followed by application of Ilizarov external fixator for tibiocalcaneal fusion and correction of foot deformity. A footplate was placed on the hindfoot to maintain a neutral foot position (Fig. ). A long incision was made from the proximal tibia to distal third, three samples for biopsy from deep tissue both bone and scar tissue was collected, and debridement was done while attempting to preserve viable bone from the remains of the tibia (Fig. ). Followed by repeated irrigation and vancomycin combined calcium sulphate was filled into the cavity then wound was closed (Fig. ). Intravenous antibiotics were administered for 2 weeks.\nA percutaneous tibial osteotomy was not done during the first stage because the remaining proximal tibia was short in length and its proximity to the infected area posed a potential risk of transfer of infection. After the infection n was subsided, the patient was scheduled for second-stage surgery, for percutaneous tibial osteotomy. One week after the procedure, distraction was started at a rate of 0.25 mm, three times per day. This rate was manipulated following callus formation and consolidation. Partial weight-bearing with the assistance of crutches and physiotherapy was advocated for his right knee to prevent knee stiffness. At discharge, the patient was advised to continue his daily distraction and was scheduled for a monthly follow up at the clinic.\nFollowing the daily distraction and monthly checkups, 9 months after surgery the tibia had grown to fuse with the calcaneus (Fig. ). The patient was taken for a third surgery for fibular osteotomy to further continue distraction osteogenesis to correct limb discrepancy. During surgery manual compression was done to avoid nonunion in the osteotomy site of the fibula (Fig. ).\nThe skin and scar tissue stretched smoothly with bone distraction. During the 14 months of distraction, the patient showed no further complications and the tibia was lengthened until discrepancy was corrected. The patient was able to walk without crutches, was fully weight-bearing and was advised to keep wearing the apparatus for 3 months to ensure continuous compression until healing was achieved at the docking site (Fig. ).\nDistraction was stopped after reaching the presumed length. Five months later, when sufficient consolidation and healing of the docking site was appreciated on the X-ray and the Ilizarov apparatus was removed. At removal, bone lengthening was recorded at 32 cm. Though the patient lost function in the foot due to the absence of ankle and subtalar joint the patient restored normal gait, he was able to walk without crutches and was able to return to school.\nShortly after, the patient showed slight discomfort with minute discrepancy and varus deformity of the tibia. He was admitted for varus deformity of 15 degrees and discrepancy correction. By using a unilateral external fixator, we corrected the angulation and further distracted the tibia for 1.5 cm, totaling distraction osteogenesis of 33.5 cm (Fig. ). After the restoration of the full length of the lower extremity and plantar grade foot, the patient was able to walk and even jog without crutches. Functional outcome was evaluated during follow up using Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) and the patient had a score of 67/80 or 83.8% at his final checkup [].","{'visit motivation':

Neurovascular and muscular status of the anterior compartment of the right lower leg was compromised, anterior tibialis was unidentified, dorsal pedis artery was weak compared to the opposite side, right foot lacked sensation on palpation and active dorsiflexion of the foot was completely lost.\nRadiology showed a tibial bone defect of about 80% of the distal length. The remaining proximal tibia showed some loss of cortex and lytic lesion (Fig. ). Fibula showed diffused osteomyelitis in the distal part. Furthermore, the X-ray showed talus bone defect and equinus deformity of the calcaneus (Fig. ).\nLaboratory results from blood work revealed ESR 26(mm/1 h), c-reactive protein 6.83(mg/L) and a slightly increased liver function AST/ALT 1.9(IU/L), otherwise normal. A biopsy was taken from the drainage sinus and culture showed the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was clear that the patient suffered from a severe diffused chronic osteomyelitis of the right tibia according to Cierny-Mader classification type IV class A []. The patient and his parents strongly insisted to focus the treatment on preserving his limb.\nAfter thorough analysis and planning, the patient was scheduled for his first stage of surgery. We started by excision of the infected part of the distal fibula, followed by application of Ilizarov external fixator for tibiocalcaneal fusion and correction of foot deformity. A footplate was placed on the hindfoot to maintain a neutral foot position (Fig. ). A long incision was made from the proximal tibia to distal third, three samples for biopsy from deep tissue both bone and scar tissue was collected, and debridement was done while attempting to preserve viable bone from the remains of the tibia (Fig. ). Followed by repeated irrigation and vancomycin combined calcium sulphate was filled into the cavity then wound was closed (Fig. ). Intravenous antibiotics were administered for 2 weeks.\nA percutaneous tibial osteotomy was not done during the first stage because the remaining proximal tibia was short in length and its proximity to the infected area posed a potential risk of transfer of infection. After the infection n was subsided, the patient was scheduled for second-stage surgery, for percutaneous tibial osteotomy. One week after the procedure, distraction was started at a rate of 0.25 mm, three times per day. This rate was manipulated following callus formation and consolidation. Partial weight-bearing with the assistance of crutches and physiotherapy was advocated for his right knee to prevent knee stiffness. At discharge, the patient was advised to continue his daily distraction and was scheduled for a monthly follow up at the clinic.\nFollowing the daily distraction and monthly checkups, 9 months after surgery the tibia had grown to fuse with the calcaneus (Fig. ). The patient was taken for a third surgery for fibular osteotomy to further continue distraction osteogenesis to correct limb discrepancy. During surgery manual compression was done to avoid nonunion in the osteotomy site of the fibula (Fig. ).\nThe skin and scar tissue stretched smoothly with bone distraction. During the 14 months of distraction, the patient showed no further complications and the tibia was lengthened until discrepancy was corrected. The patient was able to walk without crutches, was fully weight-bearing and was advised to keep wearing the apparatus for 3 months to ensure continuous compression until healing was achieved at the docking site (Fig. ).\nDistraction was stopped after reaching the presumed length. Five months later, when sufficient consolidation and healing of the docking site was appreciated on the X-ray and the Ilizarov apparatus was removed. At removal, bone lengthening was recorded at 32 cm. Though the patient lost function in the foot due to the absence of ankle and subtalar joint the patient restored normal gait, he was able to walk without crutches and was able to return to school.\nShortly after, the patient showed slight discomfort with minute discrepancy and varus deformity of the tibia. He was admitted for varus deformity of 15 degrees and discrepancy correction. By using a unilateral external fixator, we corrected the angulation and further distracted the tibia for 1.5 cm, totaling distraction osteogenesis of 33.5 cm (Fig. ). After the restoration of the full length of the lower extremity and plantar grade foot, the patient was able to walk and even jog without crutches. Functional outcome was evaluated during follow up using Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) and the patient had a score of 67/80 or 83.8% at his final checkup [].

116841,"A 43-year-old female with a significant history of chronic neck pain, migraine, and coronary artery disease presented acutely with marked exacerbation of chronic neck pain and headache. When initially seen, she was neurologically intact. While awaiting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain and cervical spine, she was found unresponsive and pulseless and required full cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The cervical MRI documented a C1-3 intradural, extramedullary, ventrolateral mass nearly filling the spinal canal resulting in severe compression of the upper cervical cord. Marked cord edema, seen on the T2 image, was present from C5 through the medulla []. Following resuscitation, the patient was awake and alert, but was found to be quadriplegic, exhibiting no movement of sensation in all four extremities. She was immediately placed on intravenous steroids and taken to the operating room for a C1-3 decompressive laminectomy and gross total resection of the tumor []. The pathological diagnosis proved to be consistent with an ATRT [Figures -].\nImmediately postoperatively, the patient remained quadriplegic. However, on the postoperative day 12, she began moving the digits of the right hand and toes on the right side. She continued to exhibit poor respiratory effort and remained intubated for 14 days, subsequently requiring tracheostomy and gastrostomy. After 36 days of inpatient care, the patient was discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Upon discharge, she began a course of 28 fractions of radiation therapy for a total dose of 5040 cGy; she finished the radiation therapy 7 weeks later. Because of low performance status, she was no deemed a suitable candidate for chemotherapy.\nTwelve weeks postoperatively, she had regained antigravity strength in both the upper extremities and was able to feed herself. She also demonstrated gross movement in both the lower extremities in all muscle groups, however, this was still deemed nonfunctional strength. The subsequent cervical MRI at four months postopertive revealed no recurrent disease. At 6 months, the patient remained in a nursing home with a stable neurological exam.\n[Figures and ] Histopathological examination of the intradural, extramedullary, cervical spine tumor showed sheets of polygonal cells separated into small groups by a network of endothelial cell-lined capillaries. The tumor cells showed the characteristic rhabdoid appearance with an eccentric vesicular nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and the typical eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion. Electron microscopic examination of rhabdoid cells showed whorled aggregates of intermediate filaments making up the pink cytoplasmic inclusions seen in the hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) section. Immunohistochemical analysis depicted the typical immunophenotype of ATRT with loss of the nuclear INI1 (SMARCB1) staining, whereas staining positive for epithelial muscle antigen (EMA), vimentin, and smooth muscle antigen.

At one year follow-up, the patient was free of pain in both shoulder joints and radiographs revealed consolidation at the fracture site with no re-dislocations occurring during the follow up period. After aggressive physiotherapy, the range of motion was near normal on the left side but slight limitation of abduction (range 0-120 degrees) was noted on the right side.

98804,"A 50-year-old male patient presented to our department with a 6-month history of increasing epigastric pain with no radiation, vomiting, and unexplained weight loss of 6 kg. His past medical, surgical, and familial histories were unremarkable, especially for malignancy. He had no habits of alcohol intake or tobacco consumption. He had a good socioeconomic status.\nAt presentation, the patient had a good general condition and his BMI was within the standard range (BMI = 22.8 kg/m2). He was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 74 beats per minute, and body temperature of 37.5°C.\nOn physical examination, the abdomen was soft with localized tenderness at the right upper quadrant. No abdominal mass or palpable pathologic lymph nodes were noted. There were no signs of portal hypertension or ascites. His routine laboratory tests on admission did not show any abnormal findings. His liver function tests and serum albumin (42 g/L) were within normal limits.\nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed and revealed an ulcero-infiltrative growth in the antrum occluding the pylorus. There were no esophageal or gastric varices. Histopathologic examination showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. There were no Helicobacter pylori or intestinal metaplasia.\nFor staging purposes, an abdominal CT scan was performed and showed irregular wall thickening of the antral wall and the pyloric channel associated with lymph nodes along the lesser curvature of the stomach (Fig. ). There was a hypervascular mass lesion in the hepatic segment VIII (50 × 30 mm) with enhancement during the arterial phase and washout during the venous phase, adjacent to the hepatic veins and the inferior vena cava, suggesting the diagnosis of HCC with no imaging features of livercirrhosis.CT scan of the chest showed normal lungs, heart, and pleural spaces, and no evidence of metastatic lesions or lymphadenopathy.\nSerological tests revealed absence of hepatitis B and C antigens. AFP and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were normal. In order to better characterize the hepatic mass, an MRI was performed and showed a typical enhancement pattern of HCC (Fig. ).\nIn the absence of clinical, biological, or imaging signs of cirrhosis, an ultrasonography-guided fine needle biopsy of the liver mass was performed and revealed pathological features in favor of HCC grade III according to the Edmondson-Steiner criteria.Histology ofnontumortissueshowed absence of liver fibrosis. There were no eosinophilic or wide lamellar bands of fibrous tissue that are characteristic of the fibrolamellar HCC (Fig. ).\nThe final diagnosis was made as double primary malignancies, consisting of gastric cancer and HCC. A multidisciplinary consultation was held. A total gastrectomy with eosojejunal anastomosis was decided without neoadjuvant chemotherapy as the tumor was complicated with pyloric stenosis.\nThe histopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with presence of signet-ring cell, infiltrating the entire gastric wall and the perigastric fat (Fig. ). Eight lesser curvature lymph nodes were involved by metastatic carcinoma. The resection was judged complete, and the final tumor staging was pT3 N3a (8/16) M0. The overlying gastric mucosa was histologically unremarkable and resection margins were free of tumor. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 1 week.\nThe HCC was considered unresectable because it invaded the vascular structures, particularly the vena cava. Therefore, the patient underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) twice for HCC, with partial response (40% of necrosis) (Fig. ). Thereafter, radiofrequency ablation was made for the residual lesion during outpatient follow-up. The patient is regularly followed up and was still in good general condition 2 years after the primary diagnosis.","{'visit motivation': 'Increasing epigastric pain, vomiting, and unexplained weight loss', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Epigastric pain, vomiting, and unexplained weight loss', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '50 years old', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'Unremarkable, especially for malignancy', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'Good socioeconomic status', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'None', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'No habits of alcohol intake', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'No tobacco consumption'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Epigastric pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Epigastric region', 'time': '6-month history', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'No radiation'}, {'name of symptom': 'Vomiting', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name of symptom': 'Unexplained weight loss', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': '6 kg'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Localized tenderness at the right upper quadrant', 'details': 'Abdomen was soft, no abdominal mass or palpable pathologic lymph nodes, no signs of portal hypertension or ascites'}, {'name': 'Routine laboratory tests', 'result': 'No abnormal findings', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Liver function tests', 'result': 'Within normal limits', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Serum albumin', 'result': '42 g/L', 'details': 'Within normal limits'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Ulcero-infiltrative growth in the antrum occluding the pylorus', 'condition': 'Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'No esophageal or gastric varices, no Helicobacter pylori or intestinal metaplasia'}, {'test': 'Abdominal CT scan', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Irregular wall thickening of the antral wall and the pyloric channel, lymph nodes along the lesser curvature of the stomach, hypervascular mass lesion in the hepatic segment VIII', 'condition': 'Suggesting the diagnosis of HCC', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'No imaging features of liver cirrhosis'}, {'test': 'CT scan of the chest', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Normal lungs, heart, and pleural spaces, no evidence of metastatic lesions or lymphadenopathy', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Serological tests', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Absence of hepatitis B and C antigens', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'AFP and carcinoembryonic antigen levels', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Normal', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'None', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?', 'What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?'], [""What is a brief summary of the patient's condition and treatment plan at discharge?"", 'Why was the patient discharged from the care center?', 'Was the patient referred to any other healthcare providers or specialists?', 'Are there any follow-up appointments or instructions for the patient?']]",Medical Examinations,Discharge,"

174759,"The 83-year-old patient presented herself at a neurological emergency department with bilateral blindness and a history of severe headache, which she described the day before. An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain had been arranged, and a massive pituitary adenoma with hemorrhage was observed, and admission to the neurosurgical department immediately followed. When arriving at the hospital the hemodynamic parameters were stable (BP 130/90, 65 BPM); Glasgow coma score was 14/15. Her medical history included chronic renal failure (III°) as well as cardiovascular disease with hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and stent. Therefore, dual oral anticoagulation with clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid was administered. Multiple electrode aggregometry did not detect effects of both anticoagulants. The neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed no perception of light in both eyes. Fundoscopy was normal without pallor of the optic nerves, no meningeal signs, and no overt clinical signs of hormone imbalance, but the measured pituitary hormone profile had a slight elevated prolactin level and suppression of sex hormones and thyroid profile (Table ). The blood tests revealed normal electrolytes and infection parameters. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a large 22 mm x 18 mm x 15 mm enhancing hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension and compression of the optic chiasm (Figure ). Emergency surgery was indicated. A transsphenoidal approach was carried out under general anesthesia. The pituitary tumor was identified, though it was not characteristic of a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma. The tumor was tough and yellow colored, and debulking with a sharp curettage was difficult. Acute hemorrhage ceased after resection of tumor. Dopamine agonist was not used due to the patient experiencing complete blindness. After decompression, the surgery was concluded. After a period of cardio-pulmonary stability in the ICU, the patient was extubated. In this case, the transsphenoidal decompression of the optic chiasm provided an improvement in both eyes. Her visual disturbance improved with visual acuity from 0 to 5/100 for both eyes postoperatively. Counting fingers, identifying persons, and color vision were possible. On the first postoperative day, she was anxious and complained of gradual increase in shortness of breath. A non-ST elevation myocardial infarction was diagnosed. Additionally, to that, she developed an acute renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis. After a short period, kidney function recovered, and cardiovascular stability was observed. The pathological examination confirmed a pituitary adenoma, most of it undergoing infarction.","{'visit motivation': 'Bilateral blindness and a history of severe headache', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Massive pituitary adenoma with hemorrhage', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Neurosurgical department'}], 'patient information': {'age': '83', 'sex': 'None', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Chronic renal failure (III°), cardiovascular disease with hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Massive pituitary adenoma with hemorrhage', 'Type': 'Transsphenoidal decompression', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Improvement in both eyes', 'details': 'The tumor was tough and yellow colored, debulking with a sharp curettage was difficult.

Patient Information:The patient is 58 years old and Female."
45291,"A 35-year-old male patient visited the King Khalid University dental clinic for the replacement of both maxillary and mandibular anterior missing teeth. The patient was extremely unhappy with existing transitional, removable partial denture due to its poor stability, especially during speech and mastication. He gave a history of teeth extraction six months before due to mobility. He also reported on chronic mouth breathing due to enlarged adenoids and blocked nasal breathing, which was surgically treated a year back. The patient gave a graphic history of continued, progressive labial flaring of anterior teeth that subsequently became mobile to be extracted. On examination, it was observed that the patient had lost both maxillary central incisors and all four mandibular incisors (). The adjacent maxillary lateral incisors showed slight labial flaring and grade 1 mobility; intraoral periapical X-ray confirmed approximately 20–25% alveolar bone loss. Routine TMJ examination showed no signs of pathology. The patency of nasal airways were checked by requesting to close the lip together and occluding one naris with the index finger alternatively. Ask the patient to breathe normally through open naris. The tongue movements were within normal limits. The evaluation of swallowing process without the removable prosthesis showed slight space between posterior teeth and minor hyperactivity of orbicularis oris and mentalis muscles. On complete evaluation of clinical signs symptoms along with clinical examination, it was diagnosed as loss of maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth due to combined effect of periodontal diseases, chronic mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting.\nThe treatment objectives were to replace the missing maxillary and mandibular central incisors along with rehabilitation of tongue thrusting habit. Treatment options to replace the missing anterior teeth was discussed with the patient, including the implant supported fixed prosthesis. The tooth that supported conventional fixed partial denture was selected according to the patient desire. The potential abutments were evaluated by the clinical and radiological examination to ascertain periodontal and pulpal health. The intentional root canal treatment was performed on maxillary right lateral incisors to gain common path of insertion. The bilateral canines and lateral incisors were the abutment for maxillary central incisors, while bilateral canines were selected as abutments for mandibular incisors []. The absence of gross soft or bony defect in the corresponding residual ridge of missing teeth was also favorable for tooth that supported fixed partial denture.\nThe diagnostic casts were made from irreversible hydrocolloid impression materials, with the help of face bow records mounted on a semiadjustable articulator. The existing removable denture had more teeth to compensate the slightly larger residual ridge space. To ascertain the esthetic outcome and patient response, the diagnostic wax up for the missing teeth structure was done (). To obtain the acceptable esthetic proportion between the teeth, it was decided to distribute the excess edentulous area between abutment and pontics.\nThe autopolymerized acrylic denture base for the edentulous area was fabricated on dental cast; the modelling plastic compound was used to make the occlusal rim. The vertical height of the occlusal rims was adjusted according to the anatomic landmarks, visibility, and phonetics. The modelling plastic compound was softened and the patient was asked to perform all physiological muscle functions by sucking, swallowing, and phonetics. The recontoured modelling compound gave the exact tooth position and inclination according to the neutral zone [].\nSplit putty indexing was made to guide the dental technician on the exact position and inclinations of pontics during fabrication of provisional restoration. The abutments were prepared for metal ceramic retainers; the definitive impression was made with heavy body-light body silicone impression materials. The poly ethyl methacrylate provisional fixed partial dentures were fabricated with indirect method. The provisional bridges were cemented with noneugenol temporary luting cement after minor correction for aesthetics, phonetics, and occlusion (). The Patient was given an instruction to follow the tongue neuromuscular sensory stimuli by brushing and resistance to regain the desirable motor response []. The patient was recalled after 24 hours to evaluate the patient opinion, gingival health, and comfort. The patient was given a scheduled appointment for six weeks to evaluate the overall satisfaction of esthetics, phonetics, and function. The continuous required minor adjustments were made to the provisional bridge during evaluation period. The provisional restorations with acceptable anterior guidance, esthetics, phonetics, and comfort were replicated to minute detail in permanent restoration.\nThe alginate impression with the cemented provisional restoration was made, and dental cast was mounted on the semiadjustable articulator with face bow transfer (). The autopolymerized acrylic customized incisal guidance table was prepared on the semiadjustable articulator from the mounted casts (). The customized incisal table enabled the dental technician to replicate the exact anterior guidance in the final restorations. The putty indexing of the provisional restorations was used to remake the labial contour, shape, and inclination in the final metal ceramic fixed partial denture. The final prosthesis was cemented with the glass-ionomer type-I luting cement after required occlusion refinements (Figures , , and ).\nThe patient was recalled after one week to evaluate the residual cement, gingival health, and occlusal integrity. The patient was monitored during the first three months with a two-week-interval, followed by a month intervening three months.

A 35-year-old male patient visited the King Khalid University dental clinic for the replacement of both maxillary and mandibular anterior missing teeth. The patient was extremely unhappy with existing transitional, removable partial denture due to its poor stability, especially during speech and mastication. He gave a history of teeth extraction six months before due to mobility. He also reported on chronic mouth breathing due to enlarged adenoids and blocked nasal breathing, which was surgically treated a year back. The patient gave a graphic history of continued, progressive labial flaring of anterior teeth that subsequently became mobile to be extracted. On examination, it was observed that the patient had lost both maxillary central incisors and all four mandibular incisors (). The adjacent maxillary lateral incisors showed slight labial flaring and grade 1 mobility; intraoral periapical X-ray confirmed approximately 20–25% alveolar bone loss. Routine TMJ examination showed no signs of pathology. The patency of nasal airways were checked by requesting to close the lip together and occluding one naris with the index finger alternatively. Ask the patient to breathe normally through open naris. The tongue movements were within normal limits. The evaluation of swallowing process without the removable prosthesis showed slight space between posterior teeth and minor hyperactivity of orbicularis oris and mentalis muscles. On complete evaluation of clinical signs symptoms along with clinical examination, it was diagnosed as loss of maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth due to combined effect of periodontal diseases, chronic mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting.\nThe treatment objectives were to replace the missing maxillary and mandibular central incisors along with rehabilitation of tongue thrusting habit. Treatment options to replace the missing anterior teeth was discussed with the patient, including the implant supported fixed prosthesis. The tooth that supported conventional fixed partial denture was selected according to the patient desire. The potential abutments were evaluated by the clinical and radiological examination to ascertain periodontal and pulpal health. The intentional root canal treatment was performed on maxillary right lateral incisors to gain common path of insertion. The bilateral canines and lateral incisors were the abutment for maxillary central incisors, while bilateral canines were selected as abutments for mandibular incisors []. The absence of gross soft or bony defect in the corresponding residual ridge of missing teeth was also favorable for tooth that supported fixed partial denture.\nThe diagnostic casts were made from irreversible hydrocolloid impression materials, with the help of face bow records mounted on a semiadjustable articulator.

176599,"The patient, a 30-year-old Tibetan man, was treated in the Lhasa Hospital for right tibiofibular fracture December 2012 (Fig. ). After the swelling subsided, he underwent right tibia fracture intramedullary internal fixation. Two weeks after the operation, the patient was able to walk with double crutches without load, and was able to walk without crutches and with some load 3 months after the operation. However, the patient complained of pain in his right lower extremity, especially when moving downhill or down stairs, and experienced a limping gait and obvious tenderness at the fracture end. Three years after originally presenting at Lhasa Hospital, the patient was experiencing persistent pain in the right lower extremity, and his daily activities were severely affected. Thus, he was re-diagnosed with nonunion of the right tibial fracture after internal fixation (Fig. ). The main causes of the nonunion of the fracture were considered to be the excessively thin intramedullary nails and unstable fixation of the fracture. The operation was repeated with replacement of the crude intramedullary nails and grafting of iliac bone (Fig. ). Three months after the operation, the tibial fracture had failed to heal, and further surgical treatment was performed. The proximal locking screw of the intramedullary nail was removed with an expectation to eliminate the stress shielding effect and to promote fracture healing by increasing the microdynamic force while retaining the static interlocking nail. Five months after the operation, the patient abandoned the crutches and was able to walk with a heavy load. Nevertheless, 2 years after the operation, active pain of the right leg persisted with some tenderness around the fracture, especially when moving downhill or down stairs. August 2018 the patient was admitted to our hospital. Physical examination revealed that two old incision healing scars, approximately 2 cm in length, were present at the proximal and distal ends of the right tibia. The middle section showed a scar from an approximately 10-cm incision; pigmentation was found around the incision and tenderness was experienced around the fracture. Imaging results revealed a nonunion of the right tibial fracture, and the admission diagnosis was nonunion of the right tibial fracture after surgery (Fig. ).\nTwo days after admission, ""right tibial locking intramedullary nail removal, open reduction and porous tantalum metal plate fixation"" was performed. After removal of intramedullary nails during the operation, nonunion of the tibial fracture was corrected and osteoporosis of the fracture end. Osteosclerosis of the fracture was observed, and the sclerotic bones as well as part of the hyperplastic epiphysis were removed; the marrow was reamed at the fracture to keep the medullary cavity open. The resected osteophytes were implanted into the fracture, followed by fixation with a porous tantalum plate.\nAfter the operation, the affected limbs were fixed with plaster. Ankle joint activity training was initiated on the first day after the operation, and knee joint activity training began 2 weeks after the operation. The patient was able to walk with double crutches without load 4 weeks after the operation and could perform normal activities 12 weeks after the operation without pain in the right limb.

157271,"A 58-year-old woman visited our hospital for evaluation of chronic hepatitis C. The patient was diagnosed as chronic hepatitis C 10 years ago, but had not received any treatment. She had been taking amlodipine 5 mg for hypertension for 8 years. She had no history of alcohol consumption, smoking, or injection drug use. Dermatological, pulmonary, cardiac and neurological examinations were normal. On her first visit to our hospital, the liver function test and the complete blood cell count were normal, and the serologic tests for hepatitis A and B and HIV were negative. She was infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b, and HCV RNA level was 3.8×106 copies/mL. There were no specific findings except for the hepatic cyst from abdominal CT scan. Liver biopsy was recommended to evaluate liver inflammation and fibrosis, but she refused. She was commenced on pegylated interferon-α2b 80 µg (1.5 µg/kg) weekly by subcutaneous injection and ribavirin 400 mg orally twice daily. Serum HCV RNA level decreased below 25 copies/mL within 12 weeks after the start of interferon, thus she achieved an early viral response.\nAfter 9 months of interferon and ribavirin treatment, the patient complained of blurred vision and headache. On physical examination, the vitiligo around her forehead and scalp was shown (), but there was no sign of meningeal irritation. Optic fundal examination showed uveitis and retinal edema. Retinal fluorescein angiography () showed leakage of fluorescein dye from the choroid into the subretinal space. The serous retinal detachment was seen clearly in the right eye from optimal coherence tomography ().

The level of angiotensin-converting enzyme showed normal range, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein were also normal, and the antinuclear antibody and the rheumatoid factor were negative. She was diagnosed as having incomplete VKH disease, therefore pegylated interferon-α2b and ribavirin were discontinued, and intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 g for 3 days, followed by daily oral administration at a dose of 60 mg prednisolone were introduced. After 2 weeks of steroid therapy, her eyesight was getting better, and retinal detachment disappeared (). Prednisolone was progressively tapered to 10 mg daily during next two months, but relapse occurred. Intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone were performed.

A 58-year-old woman visited our hospital for evaluation of chronic hepatitis C. The patient was diagnosed as chronic hepatitis C 10 years ago, but had not received any treatment. She had been taking amlodipine 5 mg for hypertension for 8 years. She had no history of alcohol consumption, smoking, or injection drug use. Dermatological, pulmonary, cardiac and neurological examinations were normal. On her first visit to our hospital, the liver function test and the complete blood cell count were normal, and the serologic tests for hepatitis A and B and HIV were negative. She was infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b, and HCV RNA level was 3.8×106 copies/mL. There were no specific findings except for the hepatic cyst from abdominal CT scan. Liver biopsy was recommended to evaluate liver inflammation and fibrosis, but she refused. She was commenced on pegylated interferon-α2b 80 µg (1.5 µg/kg) weekly by subcutaneous injection and ribavirin 400 mg orally twice daily. Serum HCV RNA level decreased below 25 copies/mL within 12 weeks after the start of interferon, thus she achieved an early viral response.\nAfter 9 months of interferon and ribavirin treatment, the patient complained of blurred vision and headache. On physical examination, the vitiligo around her forehead and scalp was shown (), but there was no sign of meningeal irritation. Optic fundal examination showed uveitis and retinal edema. Retinal fluorescein angiography () showed leakage of fluorescein dye from the choroid into the subretinal space. The serous retinal detachment was seen clearly in the right eye from optimal coherence tomography (). Cerebrospinal fluid examination and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the encephalomeningitis showed no abnormal findings. The level of angiotensin-converting enzyme showed normal range, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein were also normal, and the antinuclear antibody and the rheumatoid factor were negative. She was diagnosed as having incomplete VKH disease, therefore pegylated interferon-α2b and ribavirin were discontinued, and intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 g for 3 days, followed by daily oral administration at a dose of 60 mg prednisolone were introduced.

107092,"A 77-year-old Caucasian woman with chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, heart failure, previous nephrectomy due to clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and previous upper right lobectomy of the lung due to adenocarcinoma was admitted to the hospital because of acute hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency. She needed respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation. She was also hemodynamically unstable.\nCT angiography of the pulmonary arteries was performed. The CT scan revealed left-sided subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism and a suspicious mass in the left atrium. She was treated for pulmonary embolism. The previous CT scan of her thorax, which she had undergone a couple of months before for her pulmonary carcinoma follow-up, had shown a normal image of the heart, proving the mass in the left atrium grew de novo. The transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography discovered a massively enlarged left atrium, fibrous changes of the mitral valve and a mobile tumor formation measuring 2.8 × 3.6 cm that arose from the posterior annulus (shown in Fig. ).\nThe stem of the discovered formation was broad but did not reach the leaflet of the mitral valve. The tumor prolapsed through the mitral valve and caused severe mitral stenosis with minimal regurgitation. The tumor seemed to have caused postcapillary pulmonary hypertension as well. Cardiologists suspected it was myxoma and referred the patient to cardiac surgeons. A preoperative PET scan showed high metabolic activity in the left atrium that pointed to the possibility of the tumor's more aggressive origin, such as metastasis or a primary malignant tumor of the heart rather than myxoma. The patient underwent an open mitral valve replacement and extirpation of the tumor of the left atrium. At the time of open-heart inspection, the tumor was not encapsulated, but grew inside the atrial wall with root-like extensions. It hung on a stem that masked its appearance as myxoma on echocardiography. It did not overgrow the mitral valve (shown in Fig. ). Surgeons reconstructed the left atrial wall and replaced the diseased mitral valve with an artificial biological valve.\nA histopathological examination (shown in Fig. ) revealed a pleomorphic spindle-cell malignant tumor with high mitotic activity and focal necrosis. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for S100 protein, SOX10, PRAME and focally positive for melan A and melanoma cocktail, negative for HMB45, CD31, CD34, ERG, desmin, GMA, Myf4, h-Caldesmon, calponin, CK18, CKAE1AE3, DOG1, EMA, STAT6, PAX8, MITF, GFAP, consistent with diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.\nMolecular genetic analysis of the tumor did not confirm the presence of common genetic mutations in melanoma BRAF, NRAS or KIT, or the presence of NTRK genes fusions, but confirmed the presence of ERBB2 (HER2) gene amplification.\nThe patient experienced several anticipated postoperative complications, including atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema with respiratory failure and deterioration of a preexisting kidney disease. Following a full recovery, she was discharged from the hospital and referred to designated cancer center for further oncological treatment. Sadly, she passed away before systemic treatment initiation. The primary source of melanoma was not identified.","{'visit motivation': 'Acute hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Acute hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency and hemodynamic instability', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '77', 'sex': 'Woman', 'ethnicity': 'Caucasian', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, heart failure, previous nephrectomy due to clear cell renal cell carcinoma, previous upper right lobectomy of the lung due to adenocarcinoma', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Mobile tumor formation in the left atrium causing severe mitral stenosis and suspected to be either a myxoma or a more aggressive tumor', 'Type': 'Open mitral valve replacement and extirpation of the tumor of the left atrium', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Reconstruction of the left atrial wall and replacement of the diseased mitral valve', 'details': 'The tumor was not encapsulated, grew inside the atrial wall with root-like extensions, hung on a stem, and did not overgrow the mitral valve'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Acute hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Patient needed respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation and was hemodynamically unstable'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'CT angiography of the pulmonary arteries', 'result': 'Left-sided subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism and a suspicious mass in the left atrium', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography', 'result': 'Massively enlarged left atrium, fibrous changes of the mitral valve, and a mobile tumor formation measuring 2.8 × 3.6 cm that arose from the posterior annulus', 'details': 'The tumor prolapsed through the mitral valve causing severe mitral stenosis with minimal regurgitation and postcapillary pulmonary hypertension'}, {'name': 'Preoperative PET scan', 'result': 'High metabolic activity in the left atrium', 'details': ""Indicated the possibility of the tumor's more aggressive origin, such as metastasis or a primary malignant tumor of the heart rather than myxoma""}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'None', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'None', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Treatment for pulmonary embolism', 'related condition': 'Pulmonary embolism', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To treat the left-sided subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'Referred to cardiac surgeons by cardiologists', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['How long did the patient receive the treatment?', 'When was the treatment initiated?', 'What medication or treatment was administered?', 'Are there any additional details mentioned about the treatment (e.g., route of administration, specific instructions)?', 'How often was the medication or treatment administered?', 'What specific condition was the treatment intended to address?', 'Did the patient experience any side effects or reactions to the treatment?', 'Why was this treatment initiated?', 'What was the dosage of the medication or treatment?'], ['Are there any follow-up appointments or instructions for the patient?', 'Why was the patient discharged from the care center?', ""What is a brief summary of the patient's condition and treatment plan at discharge?"", 'Was the patient referred to any other healthcare providers or specialists?']]",Treatments,Discharge,"

88924,"A 4 year old female presented with huge abdominal swelling first noticed by her parents at 2 years of her age (See Figure ). The swelling had increased in size since then to occupy almost whole of the abdomen. Right labia had a swelling which increases in size on standing and decrease on lying down. On examination abdomen was found to be distended, felt tense with flanks full. The swelling over the labia was reducible on manipulation suggesting its continuity with the abdominal swelling.\nUltrasound abdomen showed 30 × 20 × 20 centimeters huge, multiloculated, multiseptate, lesion extending from xiphisternum to pelvis with extension into the right labia majora. Lesion was causing lateral and posterior displacement of bowel loops and compression of liver and both kidneys. A provisional diagnosis of omental, mesenteric or ovarian cyst was made. CT scan was done to throw some more light on the site of origin. Non-contrast film showed the cyst filled with clear fluid possibly arising from the mesentery. Contrast film was suggestive of multiloculated cyst. Pelvic films proved the labial extention of the cyst (See Figure ), but still the exact site of origin remained unclear.\nPatient was taken up for exploratory laparotomy and midline vertical incision was kept. After opening the peritoneum a thin walled cyst was seen popping out of the skin incision (See Figure ). On exploration it was found attached to the greater omentum (See Figure ).\nCyst was deflated partially by aspiration and we found the swelling over labia majora got reduced as we deflated the cyst and no adhesions were found between the cyst wall and labia. Complete excision of the cyst wall along with part of omentum was done.

A 4 year old female presented with huge abdominal swelling first noticed by her parents at 2 years of her age (See Figure ). The swelling had increased in size since then to occupy almost whole of the abdomen. Right labia had a swelling which increases in size on standing and decrease on lying down. On examination abdomen was found to be distended, felt tense with flanks full. The swelling over the labia was reducible on manipulation suggesting its continuity with the abdominal swelling.\nUltrasound abdomen showed 30 × 20 × 20 centimeters huge, multiloculated, multiseptate, lesion extending from xiphisternum to pelvis with extension into the right labia majora. Lesion was causing lateral and posterior displacement of bowel loops and compression of liver and both kidneys. A provisional diagnosis of omental, mesenteric or ovarian cyst was made. CT scan was done to throw some more light on the site of origin. Non-contrast film showed the cyst filled with clear fluid possibly arising from the mesentery. Contrast film was suggestive of multiloculated cyst. Pelvic films proved the labial extention of the cyst (See Figure ), but still the exact site of origin remained unclear.\nPatient was taken up for exploratory laparotomy and midline vertical incision was kept. After opening the peritoneum a thin walled cyst was seen popping out of the skin incision (See Figure ). On exploration it was found attached to the greater omentum (See Figure ).\nCyst was deflated partially by aspiration and we found the swelling over labia majora got reduced as we deflated the cyst and no adhesions were found between the cyst wall and labia. Complete excision of the cyst wall along with part of omentum was done. Histopathological report of the cyst wall showed endothelial cell lining, foam cells, lymphatic spaces, lymphoid tissue and smooth muscles which are diagnostic of lymphangiomatous cyst (See Figure ). Patient was under follow up for since six months and had no clinical and radiological signs of recurrence.

27048,"The patient is a 39-year-old male with a clinical picture that began at six years of age. He presented muscular weakness of progressive establishment, with a frequency of one episode per month, which worsened with intense physical exertion, associated with intercurrent febrile symptoms that limited his ability to perform physical activity. The crisis was variable in intensity, some of them presenting only with mild to moderate weakness and some others with complete paralysis. During infancy, nonpotassium alteration was documented during the crisis. Although the situation was periodic, the patient did not suffer motor development delay, and he achieved all his milestones without difficulty.\nCrisis worsens in adulthood, being more severe and related to physical exercise of moderate intensity. No other triggers were identified as drugs or anesthetic events. Many of the episodes required short-term hospitalizations lasting two or three days. During hospitalizations, several electrocardiograms, brain MRI, and toxic profiles were normal. Other paraclinical tests, such as renal and thyroid function, hepatic function, screening for Pompe disease, and levels of lactic acid and pyruvate, were within normal limits.\nDuring the last crisis, the only positive findings were mild to moderately increased CPK levels (values ranged between 209 and 873 U/L). Also, potassium measurements reached levels until 5.3 mEq/L in blood samples analyzed during the weakness and paralysis episodes. The electromyography study performed by multiMUP (multimotor unit potential) showed no abnormalities. These preliminary findings were interpreted as compatible with muscle fiber disease.\nHe did not present with important personal antecedents, although he stated that a paternal great-uncle died at age 50 due to a condition associated with motor impairment; however, in that case, there was no specific diagnosis.\nOn physical examination, the patient presented weakness of proximal predominance in all the four extremities, with 4+/5 strength in shoulder abductors and adductors, elbow flexors, and extenders; in lower extremities, he presented 4/5 strength in hip flexors and extenders, as well as knee flexors. The rest of the muscle groups were within normal limits. He also showed four limb hyporeflexia, normal muscle tone, and gastrocnemius hypertrophy (see ).\nA muscle biopsy performed at sixteen years old showed isolated muscle necrosis with reparative changes. A second biopsy performed in adulthood showed changes of denervation, regenerating fibers, increased lipid deposition, and intracytoplasmic glycogen deposits.\nConsidering the histopathological findings of the second biopsy, an NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) genetic diagnosis panel was requested, which included the PYGM, PGAM1, PFKM, and LDHA genes for glycogen storage disease. The NGS panel showed no alterations.\nLater, due to the course of the disease and the presence of relapses suggestive of periodic paralysis associated with abnormal potassium levels, it was decided to request a new genetic panel for periodic paralysis, which included the CACN1S, KCNA2, KCNJ2, KCNJ5, and SCN4A genes.\nThe panel demonstrated a missense variant in SCN4A c.4483A > G (p.Ile1495Val.). This variant has not been previously reported in the literature. However, it is considered likely pathogenic according to the ACMG/ACP standards [] and Sherloc criteria []. None of the parents have the same variant, and none of them or any other family members were symptomatic.\nBased on clinical presentation, the increased levels of potassium during the crisis, and the likely pathogenic variant found in gene SCN4A, we decided to start treating the patient as a case of hyperkalemic paralysis, prescribing hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, subsequently increasing it 50 mg daily. A comprehensive rehabilitation plan tailored to the specific pathology was also established and specific diet recommendations. With this treatment, the patient presented a marked improvement in both weakness symptoms and functionality, and the frequency of weakness episodes was reduced.","{'visit motivation': 'Progressive muscular weakness and paralysis episodes', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Muscular weakness and paralysis episodes', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'Two or three days', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '39', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'Paternal great-uncle died at age 50 due to a condition associated with motor impairment, without a specific diagnosis.', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Muscular weakness began at six years of age, no motor development delay, achieved all milestones without difficulty.', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'Crisis worsened with intense physical exertion.', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'None', 'Type': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Muscular weakness', 'intensity of symptom': 'Variable, from mild to moderate weakness to complete paralysis', 'location': 'Proximal predominance in all four extremities', 'time': 'One episode per month since six years of age', 'temporalisation': 'Progressive establishment', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'Worsened with intense physical exertion', 'details': 'Associated with intercurrent febrile symptoms'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Weakness of proximal predominance in all the four extremities, with 4+/5 strength in shoulder abductors and adductors, elbow flexors, and extenders; in lower extremities, he presented 4/', 'details': 'None'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Electrocardiograms, brain MRI, toxic profiles, renal and thyroid function tests, hepatic function tests, screening for Pompe disease, levels of lactic acid and pyruvate', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Normal', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'During hospitalizations'}, {'test': 'CPK levels', 'severity': 'Mild to moderately increased', 'result': 'Values ranged between 209 and 873 U/L', 'condition': 'Muscle fiber disease', 'time': 'During the last crisis', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Potassium measurements', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Levels until 5.3 mEq/L', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'During the weakness and paralysis episodes', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Electromyography study by multiMUP', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'No abnormalities', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'None', 'related condition': 'None', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'None', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[[""What is the primary reason for the patient's admission?"", 'Where was the patient admitted (e.g., hospital name, department)?', 'How long did the patient stay in the care center?

35580,"A 28-year-old woman had a history of sudden onset of syncope diagnosed as paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. She underwent electric ablation and placement of an ICD in her left shoulder. She had poor wound healing at a 5-month follow-up visit and she was admitted to the hospital on December 1, 2008 for management of a pocket infection. Exposure of the ICD generator and pacing lead were found on February 26, 2009, and the generator was removed, leaving the pacing lead in place. She had episodic pyrexia beginning in May 2009 and her blood cultures grew MRSA (isolate st01, positive in one of two sets blood cultures collected). ICD device-related endocarditis was highly suspected. Intravenous antibiotics with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours for 14 days followed by oral linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for another 14 days were prescribed for her endocarditis, but the blood cultures still grew MRSA (isolate st02, positive in one of two sets blood cultures collected). A thoracotomy was planned to remove the pacing lead. However, because of three episodes of broken peripheral venous catheter tips left in the vessels, generator displacement requiring surgical intervention, and emotional fragility, the surgical intervention was postponed due to the high possibility of postoperative wound infection and further osteomyelitis. Daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg/kg daily was prescribed for its effective biofilm penetration ability and rapid bacteriocidal efficacy, and the subsequent blood culture (one set collected) yielded negative finding. A total 65 days of treatment were completed and the patient was discharged on October 24, 2009.\nUnfortunately, spiking fever and chills occurred 1 day after discharge and the blood cultures grew MRSA again (isolates st03, positive in one of two blood cultures collected). During antibiotic treatment with intravenous tigecycline (100-mg loading dose and 50 mg every 12 hours for 14 days), one of two sets of blood cultures grew MRSA (isolate st04). Teicoplanin 400 mg every 12 hours for another 14 days was given, but another one of two sets of blood cultures grew MRSA (isolate st05). Intravenous daptomycin was prescribed at a dosage of up to 9 mg/kg daily in combination with intravenous fosfomycin 6 g every 6 hours starting December 16, 2009, due to the persistence of MRSA bacteremia with the ICD device in place. The patient's fever subsided after these treatments and the next three sets of blood cultures were negative 1 week after the start of daptomycin-fosfomycin combination therapy. However, transesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetations growing on the pacing lead, and a scan for osteomyelitis showed increased uptake of the radiotracer in the left proximal clavicle. Moreover, the daptomycin Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) of MRSA isolate st05 indicated that it was nonsusceptible to daptomycin, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 1.5 to 2 mg/L. After discussion among the surgeons and infectious disease specialists, a thoracotomy was performed on December 22, 2009 for removal of the pacing lead due to the previous persistence of S. aureus bacteremia; high-dose daptomycin 12 mg/kg intravenously daily was also started. A vegetation measuring 1.3 × 0.6 × 0.1 cm was found on the pacing lead, but the Gram stain showed no microbes. Tissue culture of the vegetation found on the pacing lead grew MRSA (isolate st06), as did as the tip of the pacing lead (isolate st07).\nBecause the osteomyelitis scan was positive, combination therapy with daptomycin 12 mg/kg intravenously daily and fosfomycin 6 g intravenously every 6 hours was administered for total of 56 days.

A 28-year-old woman had a history of sudden onset of syncope diagnosed as paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. She underwent electric ablation and placement of an ICD in her left shoulder. She had poor wound healing at a 5-month follow-up visit and she was admitted to the hospital on December 1, 2008 for management of a pocket infection. Exposure of the ICD generator and pacing lead were found on February 26, 2009, and the generator was removed, leaving the pacing lead in place. She had episodic pyrexia beginning in May 2009 and her blood cultures grew MRSA (isolate st01, positive in one of two sets blood cultures collected). ICD device-related endocarditis was highly suspected. Intravenous antibiotics with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours for 14 days followed by oral linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for another 14 days were prescribed for her endocarditis, but the blood cultures still grew MRSA (isolate st02, positive in one of two sets blood cultures collected). A thoracotomy was planned to remove the pacing lead. However, because of three episodes of broken peripheral venous catheter tips left in the vessels, generator displacement requiring surgical intervention, and emotional fragility, the surgical intervention was postponed due to the high possibility of postoperative wound infection and further osteomyelitis. Daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg/kg daily was prescribed for its effective biofilm penetration ability and rapid bacteriocidal efficacy, and the subsequent blood culture (one set collected) yielded negative finding. A total 65 days of treatment were completed and the patient was discharged on October 24, 2009.\nUnfortunately, spiking fever and chills occurred 1 day after discharge and the blood cultures grew MRSA again (isolates st03, positive in one of two blood cultures collected). During antibiotic treatment with intravenous tigecycline (100-mg loading dose and 50 mg every 12 hours for 14 days), one of two sets of blood cultures grew MRSA (isolate st04). Teicoplanin 400 mg every 12 hours for another 14 days was given, but another one of two sets of blood cultures grew MRSA (isolate st05). Intravenous daptomycin was prescribed at a dosage of up to 9 mg/kg daily in combination with intravenous fosfomycin 6 g every 6 hours starting December 16, 2009, due to the persistence of MRSA bacteremia with the ICD device in place. The patient's fever subsided after these treatments and the next three sets of blood cultures were negative 1 week after the start of daptomycin-fosfomycin combination therapy. However, transesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetations growing on the pacing lead, and a scan for osteomyelitis showed increased uptake of the radiotracer in the left proximal clavicle. Moreover, the daptomycin Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) of MRSA isolate st05 indicated that it was nonsusceptible to daptomycin, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 1.5 to 2 mg/L. After discussion among the surgeons and infectious disease specialists, a thoracotomy was performed on December 22, 2009 for removal of the pacing lead due to the previous persistence of S. aureus bacteremia; high-dose daptomycin 12 mg/kg intravenously daily was also started. A vegetation measuring 1.3 × 0.6 × 0.1 cm was found on the pacing lead, but the Gram stain showed no microbes. Tissue culture of the vegetation found on the pacing lead grew MRSA (isolate st06), as did as the tip of the pacing lead (isolate st07).\nBecause the osteomyelitis scan was positive, combination therapy with daptomycin 12 mg/kg intravenously daily and fosfomycin 6 g intravenously every 6 hours was administered for total of 56 days. The patient had no further pyretic episodes following hospitalization. A follow-up osteomyelitis scan on March 8, 2010 was negative, and follow-up transthoracic echocardiography showed no vegetation. The patient's symptoms were attributed to endocarditis; she remained symptom free during 12 months of follow-up.

20856,"This is a 42-year-old African American female who had an incidental finding of a new 17-mm pancreatic tail cystic lesion found on a CT scan during workup for abdominal pain. Patient was lost to follow-up, until a repeat CT scan 1 year later demonstrated a stable low attenuation, 15 mm × 11 mm pancreatic tail cyst (\n). She complained of decreased appetite and intermittent epigastric pain over the last year. She was referred for EUS with FNA for further evaluation of the cyst. Her history is significant for diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency (well-controlled), alcohol and intermittent substance usage (marijuana and cocaine), recent ventral hernia repair, and family history significant only for breast and lung cancer. She has no significant tobacco usage history. No prior episodes of pancreatitis, known pancreatic disorder, or prior intervention. Exam is otherwise unremarkable, without palpable mass, jaundice, or tenderness to palpation. The patient underwent an EUS which found a complex cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail and an abnormal lymph node in the peripancreatic region (\n). The pancreatic lesion had high-risk features, demonstrating both cystic and atypical solid components, measuring 27 mm × 9 mm, and abutting the splenic vessels near the hilum without invasion and a 27 mm × 11 mm enlarged peripancreatic lymph node. Both were sampled by FNA. Approximately 5 mL of pancreatic cystic fluid was obtained which appeared cloudy, blood tinged, and viscous. Fluid analysis demonstrated CEA level of 5,327.7 ng/mL, amylase of 335 U/L, and glucose of 69 mg/dL. Cytology demonstrated benign appearing squamous cells and a few atypical, degenerated cells. Lymph node findings were benign. Serum CA 19–9 was low at <3 U/L.\nGiven these high-risk findings the patient underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Intraoperative findings included no evidence of distant metastatic disease, no worrisome lymphadenopathy, and a lesion in the pancreatic tail without invasions into surrounding tissues. Pathological evaluation demonstrated IPAS with associated benign epithelial-lined mucinous cyst, without in situ or invasive carcinoma identified. The cyst lining shows squamoid and apocrine features. No goblet cells are identified. Immunohistochemistry shows positive staining for CEA in the cyst lining (\n). Twelve benign lymph nodes negative for carcinoma and negative margins. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged on postoperative day 6. At outpatient postoperative visit, she continued to do well and had no ongoing issues with abdominal pain.","{'visit motivation': 'Incidental finding of a new pancreatic tail cystic lesion', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Further evaluation of the pancreatic tail cyst', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '42', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'African American', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'Family history significant only for breast and lung cancer', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Diabetes mellitus, recent ventral hernia repair', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'Human immunodeficiency (well-controlled)', 'alcohol consumption': 'Alcohol usage', 'drug usage': 'Intermittent substance usage (marijuana and cocaine)', 'smoking status': 'No significant tobacco usage history'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'High-risk findings of a complex cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail', 'Type': 'Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'No evidence of distant metastatic disease, no worrisome lymphadenopathy, and a lesion in the pancreatic tail without invasions into surrounding', 'details': 'None'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Decreased appetite', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'None', 'time': 'Over the last year', 'temporalisation': 'Intermittent', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'name of symptom': 'Intermittent epigastric pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Epigastric region', 'time': 'Over the last year', 'temporalisation': 'Intermittent', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Unremarkable', 'details': 'Without palpable mass, jaundice, or tenderness to palpation'}, {'name': 'EUS', 'result': 'Complex cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail and an abnormal lymph node in the peripancreatic region', 'details': 'Pancreatic lesion had high-risk features, demonstrating both cystic and atypical solid components, measuring 27 mm × 9 mm, and abutting the splenic vessels near the hilum without invasion and a 27 mm × 11 mm enlarged peripancreatic lymph node'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'CT scan', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Stable low attenuation, 15 mm × 11 mm pancreatic tail cyst', 'condition': 'Pancreatic tail cystic lesion', 'time': '1 year after the initial finding', 'details': 'Initial finding was a 17-mm lesion'}, {'test': 'Fluid analysis', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'CEA level of 5,327.7 ng/mL, amylase of 335 U/L, and glucose of 69 mg/dL', 'condition': 'Pancreatic tail cystic lesion', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Fluid was cloudy, blood tinged, and viscous'}, {'test': 'Cytology', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Benign appearing squamous cells and a few atypical, degenerated cells', 'condition': 'Pancreatic tail cystic lesion', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Lymph node findings', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Benign', 'condition': 'Abnormal lymph node in the peripancreatic region', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}, {'test': 'Serum CA 19–9', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Low at <3 U/L', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'None'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'EUS with FNA', 'related condition': 'Pancreatic tail cystic lesion and abnormal lymph node', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Further evaluation of the cyst', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'Both the pancreatic lesion and lymph node were sampled by FNA'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?', 'What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?'], ['When was the surgery performed?', 'What was the outcome of the surgery (e.g., successful, complications)?', 'Are there any specific details mentioned about the surgical procedure or complications?', 'What type of surgery was performed?', 'What was the reason for the surgery?']]",Medical Examinations,Surgeries,"

Intraoperative findings included no evidence of distant metastatic disease, no worrisome lymphadenopathy, and a lesion in the pancreatic tail without invasions into surrounding tissues. Pathological evaluation demonstrated IPAS with associated benign epithelial-lined mucinous cyst, without in situ or invasive carcinoma identified. The cyst lining shows squamoid and apocrine features. No goblet cells are identified. Immunohistochemistry shows positive staining for CEA in the cyst lining (\n). Twelve benign lymph nodes negative for carcinoma and negative margins. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged on postoperative day 6. At outpatient postoperative visit, she continued to do well and had no ongoing issues with abdominal pain.

36304,"A 25-year-old Saudi female, who is medically free, presented to our emergency department complaining of a mass in the mons pubis. The mass was occasionally tender and had rapidly increased in size in two-week duration. No other complains or masses at other sites were reported. On clinical examination, an ill-defined soft mass was identified in the mons pubis, extending to the left inguinal area with a hyperemic overlying skin. Laboratory tests were within normal limits except for a mild leukocytosis. The clinical impression was of an abscess, and the patient was scheduled for surgery. A local excision of the mass was done, and the specimen was sent to the histopathology department. The patient was discharged on the next day of surgery.\nGrossly, the specimen consisted of two irregular pieces of soft tissue. Both masses were partially encapsulated and measured 6 × 5 × 2 cm and 6.5 × 6 × 2.5 cm, respectively. The outer surface of both masses was irregular. Serial slicing of the masses revealed a heterogeneous cut surface with pale white and dark tan areas. Random sections from both masses were taken for histopathological examination.\nH&E slides showed a poorly differentiated neoplasm. The tumor consisted exclusively of cells retaining the classical ""rhabdoid"" morphology (). The cells were discohesive with distinct cell borders, and they were arranged in solid sheets. The amount of cytoplasm varied between scant to abundant. The cytoplasm had a prominent eosinophilic quality, and intracytoplasmic glassy eosinophilic inclusions were seen within the majority of the cells. The nuclei were vesicular, eccentric, and highly pleomorphic with prominent nucleoli. Numerous mitoses were seen (45 mitoses/10 HPF). Occasional multinucleated tumor giant cells were present. There were neither areas of necrosis nor lymphovascular invasion.\nAn extended panel of antibodies was performed on Ventana using the iVIEW DAB detection kit and showed focal cytoplasmic immunoreactivity to vimentin (mouse monoclonal, 1 : 60; Dako) with the characteristic globular cytoplasmic configuration indenting the nucleus. The cytoplasm of tumor cells also coexpressed cytokeratin cocktail (mouse monoclonal, AE1/AE3, 1 : 100; Dako), CK 8 (mouse monoclonal, ready to use; Dako), and CK 19 (mouse monoclonal, 1 : 40; Dako). The tumor cells, in comparison to the endothelial lining of the capillaries, showed loss of INI1 (mouse monoclonal, BAF 47, ready to use; BD Transduction Laboratories, USA) nuclear staining (). Anti-Ki-67 (mouse monoclonal, 1 : 50; Dako) showed a high proliferation index reaching up to 80% of tumor cells. Tumor cells have showed nuclear positivity to ER (mouse monoclonal, 1 : 20; Dako) (weak to moderate in 90%) () and have also showed nuclear positivity to PR (mouse monoclonal, 1 : 100; Dako) (strong in 20%).

77953,"A 77-year-old man with a history of peptic ulcer disease was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward for the treatment of septic arthritis. During the hospitalization, he developed hemodynamic instability following acute, massive hematemesis of approximately 750 mL of fresh blood and clot (nadir blood pressure 74/36 mmHg, pulse 110 bpm). Endotracheal intubation was performed along with resuscitation with volume and blood product; a continuous infusion of pantoprazole was initiated and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for urgent gastroscopy.\nInitial gastroscopy revealed an adherent blood clot occupying the distal esophagus, extending to the gastric cardia and proximal fundus. The clot could not be dislodged despite attempts with a water jet and wire snare, and neither the underlying lesion nor bleeding site could be identified. Five milliliters of a 1:10 000 solution of epinephrine was injected into and surrounding the clot. The remaining mucosa, as far as the third stage of the duodenum, was unremarkable except for pallor. Blood work revealed an initial drop in hemoglobin from 115 g/L to 86 g/L with a normal INR and platelet count. Four units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) were administered and an infusion of norepinephrine was required to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure.\nDespite aggressive initial management, the patient required an additional four units of PRBCs, five units of platelets and five units of fresh frozen plasma, along with increasing doses of norepinephrine. Therefore, aggressive gastric lavage with over 3 liters of normal saline was performed, followed by immediate repeat gastroscopy. The actively bleeding site was now identified as arising within severely ulcerated esophageal mucosa just proximal to the gastro-esophageal (GE) junction; no esophageal or gastric varices were present. The area was injected with 10 mL of 1:10 000 epinephrine solution and treated with coaptive electrocoagulation, with apparent hemostasis. However, the patient did not demonstrate prolonged stability and recurrently bled, with the need for increasing hemodynamic support. Interventional radiology and general surgery were consulted and a multi-disciplinary discussion concluded that the patient was too unstable for transfer to the angiography suite and surgical morbidity and mortality was prohibitive. Given the location of the bleeding, a decision was made to immediately place a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. Only the gastric balloon was inflated in an attempt to tamponade the GE junction. The balloon remained inflated for four hours and was then deflated to minimize mucosal ischemia, followed by a final three hours of inflation. During this time, the patient achieved and maintained hemodynamic stability with no transfusion requirements nor intravenous pressure support. There were no further clinical signs of active bleeding and the patient was transferred to a medical ward two days after the intervention with the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube and was discharged home four days later.","{'visit motivation': 'Treatment of septic arthritis', 'admission': [{'reason': 'Septic arthritis', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Internal Medicine

The actively bleeding site was now identified as arising within severely ulcerated esophageal mucosa just proximal to the gastro-esophageal (GE) junction; no esophageal or gastric varices were present. The area was injected with 10 mL of 1:10 000 epinephrine solution and treated with coaptive electrocoagulation, with apparent hemostasis. However, the patient did not demonstrate prolonged stability and recurrently bled, with the need for increasing hemodynamic support. Interventional radiology and general surgery were consulted and a multi-disciplinary discussion concluded that the patient was too unstable for transfer to the angiography suite and surgical morbidity and mortality was prohibitive. Given the location of the bleeding, a decision was made to immediately place a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. Only the gastric balloon was inflated in an attempt to tamponade the GE junction. The balloon remained inflated for four hours and was then deflated to minimize mucosal ischemia, followed by a final three hours of inflation. During this time, the patient achieved and maintained hemodynamic stability with no transfusion requirements nor intravenous pressure support. There were no further clinical signs of active bleeding and the patient was transferred to a medical ward two days after the intervention with the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube and was discharged home four days later.

5598,"The first case we present is that of a 29-year-old woman who presented to the clinic with the complaint of an enlarging left breast mass. She first noticed that this mass almost 2 years ago and mentions that it has been growing in size and becoming more erythematous and tender. She did not report any recent weight loss or change in appetite. She is married with 2 children, and she does not have any illnesses. She smokes hubble-bubble almost 4 times per week and does not drink alcohol. Surgical history is significant for 2 previous Cesarean sections with no complications. History of her current illness dates back to June 2016 when the patient felt a mass in her left breast; upon further investigation, she was diagnosed with idiopathic granulomatous mastitis and later (December 2017) developed an abscess that drained on its own. She was initially treated with methotrexate and later switched to prednisone and mycophenolate with minimal improvement. At the clinic, her vitals were within normal limits, and on physical examination, there was a left breast lump found at the upper inner quadrant with some erythema and inflammation surrounding it. Moreover, there was some skin retraction in this area.\nCore biopsy done at an outside hospital in June 2017 revealed no granulomas. Ultrasound done at that time showed a persistent ill-defined hypoechoic mass that appeared initially subdermally and was spanning more than 4 × 1.4 cm. Moreover, multiple deeper masses were seen, one of which was not located within the breast measuring 12.3 × 8.5 mm. Axillary nodes were insignificant and not well appreciated on imaging.\nFine-needle aspirate done in July 2017 was negative for malignancy and was reported to have abscess formation. The slides revealed a heavy inflammatory infiltrate predominantly composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. No ductal epithelial cells were seen.\nCore biopsy done in November of the same year showed multiple noncaseating epithelioid granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and occasional multinucleated giant cells. Some granulomas contained neutrophils forming microabscesses with surrounding empty microcysts ().\nThe Ziehl–Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli was negative. This leads to the diagnosis of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis which is a diagnosis of exclusion.\nA repeat MRI done during June 2018 showed heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue with mild background enhancement. There are also numerous tiny rim-enhancing fluid collections in the left breast, the largest measuring 8 mm involving the upper inner and lower inner quadrants, some of which are fistulizing to the skin. Findings have regressed compared to the prior MRI.\nAs with the previous MRI, no enlarged axillary or internal mammary adenopathy was seen.\nThose findings are consistent with biopsy-proven idiopathic granulomatous mastitis extensively involving the upper and lower inner quadrants of the left breast.","{'visit motivation': 'Enlarging left breast mass', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '29', 'sex': 'Woman', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'Married with 2 children, no illnesses', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'Does not drink alcohol', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'Smokes hubble-bubble almost 4 times per week'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Childbirth', 'Type': 'Cesarean sections', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'No complications', 'details': '2 previous Cesarean sections'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Breast mass', 'intensity of symptom': 'Growing in size, becoming more erythematous and tender', 'location': 'Left breast, upper inner quadrant', 'time': 'First noticed almost 2 years ago', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'Skin retraction in the area of the lump'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Left breast lump with erythema and inflammation', 'details': 'Lump found at the upper inner quadrant with some skin retraction'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Core biopsy', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'No granulomas', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'June 2017', 'details': 'Done at an outside hospital'}, {'test': 'Ultrasound', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Persistent ill-defined hypoechoic mass, multiple deeper masses, one mass not located within the breast', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'June 2017', 'details': 'Mass initially subdermal, spanning more than 4 × 1.4 cm, one mass measuring 12.3 × 8.5 mm, axillary nodes insignificant'}, {'test': 'Fine-needle aspirate', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Negative for malignancy, abscess formation', 'condition': 'None', 'time': 'July 2017', 'details': 'Heavy inflammatory infiltrate predominantly composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, no ductal epithelial cells seen'}, {'test': 'Core biopsy', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Multiple noncaseating epithelioid granulomas', 'condition': 'Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis', 'time': 'November 2017', 'details': 'Composed of epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Methotrexate', 'related condition': 'Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Initial treatment', 'reaction to treatment': 'Minimal improvement', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Prednisone', 'related condition': 'Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Switched from methotrexate', 'reaction to treatment': 'Minimal improvement', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Mycophenolate', 'related condition': 'Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'Switched from methotrexate', 'reaction to treatment': 'Minimal improvement', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[[""What is the motivation for the patient's visit?""], [""What is the patient's sex assigned at birth?"", 'Did the patient travel recently, and could it be relevant to the current condition?

Shortly after the procedure though, she became hypotensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic, and she was admitted to the ICU.\nChest X-ray at this time demonstrated new right-sided infiltrates, thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia, and the patient was started on vancomycin and meropenem. There was also a concern for esophageal perforation, so a CT scan was performed, and it revealed a large right posterior thoracic mass with a mediastinal invasion that was obstructing the right pulmonary artery, in addition to an enlarged right heart. An echocardiogram that was also done showed right ventricular dilation, along with severe pulmonary hypertension, with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 75-80 mmHg.\nDespite optimal management, the patient continued to be tachypneic, hypoxemic, and dyspneic. As her respiratory status continued to decline, the patient was intubated, and the family decided to have a 'do not resuscitate' order for the patient. During her stay in the ICU, the patient became consistently tachycardic with a heart rate ranging from 100 to 120 beats per minute.

195017,"A 35-year-old man presented at a local hospital with epigastric pain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed that an IVC filter strut had penetrated the third portion of the duodenum (arrow, Fig. ), and this was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) (arrow, Fig. ). In order to retrieve the IVC filter, the patient was referred to our department. He had a history of testicular cancer with para-aorta lymph node metastasis. Left renal vein thrombosis developed because of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before RPLND, and anticoagulants were administered before RPLND. Three years previously, he had undergone left orchiectomy, retro-mediastinal lymph node dissection, and RPLND at the previous hospital. The left common iliac vein was intraoperatively damaged during RPLND. Because the previous surgeon was worried about the high incidence of postoperative DVT and PTE, anticoagulant therapy was continued after RPLND. However, because DVT developed in the left common iliac vein after the initial surgery, a retrievable IVC filter (ALN, France) was placed in the IVC caudal to the renal vein to prevent PTE, and the patient had been receiving anticoagulant therapy. Because follow-up CT after IVC filter placement showed that DVT persisted at the left common iliac vein despite anticoagulant therapy, the IVC filter could not be retrieved at the previous hospital.\nEnhanced CT also revealed that DVT remained in the left common iliac vein. Because ultrasound examination showed organized DVT, an IVC filter was considered unnecessary. An endovascular approach was considered unfeasible for retrieval because two of the filter struts had penetrated the duodenal wall. An extensive discussion with an internal medicine specialist was performed. Because DVT remained with no remarkable changes in CT images for 3 years and the incidence of PTE caused by DVT in the left common iliac vein would be low, we chose surgical treatment for this patient in order to prevent bleeding at the duodenum.\nThe IVC filter was retrieved through cavotomy, and the duodenal penetration site was repaired using intraoperative EGD clipping. The operation lasted 5 h and 54 min, and the intraoperative bleeding volume was 1172 mL. Because it was not possible to mobilize the duodenum due to adhesions resulting from the previous surgery, the IVC at the sites caudal to the renal vein could not be explored. However, a mesenteric incision caudal to the third portion of the duodenum enabled encircling and taping of the IVC (Fig. ). After clamping the IVC cranial and caudal to the duodenum, a 5-cm vertical incision was made on the IVC cranial to the duodenum and the IVC filter was retrieved (Fig. a). Although the head of the IVC filter had penetrated into the IVC intima, we were able to bluntly peel the filter head from the intima. The IVC incision was closed using a continuous 5-0 Prolene suture (arrow, Fig. b). The IVC clamping time was 22 min. Intraoperative EGD revealed no bleeding at the duodenal penetration site (Fig. ). To prevent duodenal bleeding or perforation, the penetration site was repaired by EGD clipping. Retrieved IVC filter was presented as (Fig. ). The patient did not develop any postoperative complications and was discharged on postoperative day 16.","{'visit motivation': 'Epigastric pain', 'admission': [{'reason': 'To retrieve an IVC filter', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'Referred to the department for IVC filter retrieval'}], 'patient information': {'age': '35', 'sex': 'Male', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'None', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'None'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'History of testicular cancer with para-aorta lymph node metastasis, left renal vein thrombosis due to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before RPLND', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Testicular cancer with para-aorta lymph node metastasis', 'Type': 'Left orchiectomy, retro-mediastinal lymph node dissection, and RPLND', 'time': 'Three years previously', 'outcome': 'Left common iliac vein was intraoperatively damaged during RPLND', 'details': 'Anticoagulant therapy was continued after RPLND due to concern about high incidence of postoperative DVT and PTE'}, {'reason': 'DVT developed in the left common iliac vein after initial surgery', 'Type': 'Placement of a retrievable IVC filter (ALN, France) in the IVC caudal to the renal vein', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'DVT persisted at the left common iliac vein despite anticoagulant therapy', 'details': 'IVC filter could not be retrieved at the previous hospital'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Epigastric pain', 'intensity of symptom': 'None', 'location': 'Epigastric region', 'time': 'None', 'temporalisation': 'None', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'EGD showed IVC filter strut had penetrated the third portion of the duodenum'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)', 'result': 'IVC filter strut had penetrated the third portion of the duodenum', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Ultrasound examination', 'result': 'Organized DVT', 'details': 'IVC filter considered unnecessary'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Computed tomography (CT)', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Confirmation of IVC filter strut penetration into the duodenum; DVT remained in the left common iliac vein', 'condition': 'IVC filter strut penetration, DVT', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'Follow-up CT showed persistent DVT despite anticoagulant therapy; no remarkable changes in CT images for 3 years'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Anticoagulants', 'related condition': 'Left renal vein thrombosis, DVT in the left common iliac vein', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'Before RPLND and continued after RPLND', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To prevent postoperative DVT and PTE, and due to development of DVT after initial surgery', 'reaction to treatment': 'DVT persisted despite anticoagulant therapy', 'details': 'None'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'Surgical treatment chosen to prevent bleeding at the duodenum and because the incidence of PTE caused by DVT in the left common iliac vein would be low', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'The IVC filter was retrieved'}}","[['Are there any specific details mentioned about the examination findings?', 'What were the results of the examination (e.g., normal, abnormal)?', 'What specific medical examination was performed (e.g., X-ray, blood test)?'], [""What is the patient's sex assigned at birth?"", ""What is the patient's age?"", ""What are the patient's main symptoms or concerns upon admission?"", ""Does the note mention any details about the patient's socioeconomic background (e.g., occupation, insurance status)?"", 'Does the note mention any significant family history of medical conditions?', ""What is the patient's ethnicity?

162133,"An 8-year-old girl suffered from a painless swelling in the left submandibular area that had been progressively enlarging over the previous four months. There was no history of local trauma, surgery or infections on the left side of her face or neck. Her medical and family histories were also unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a soft, mobile, well-circumscribed superficial mass 3 cm in diameter in the left submandibular area. There was no swelling in the floor of the mouth, and the oral mucosa was unremarkable. Computed tomography revealed that a 2.6 cm, cone-shaped, high-density mass with internal microcalcifications was located in the left submandibular gland along the lateral surfaces of the hyoglossus muscle and genioglossus muscle. The mass extended from the anterior aspect of the submandibular gland deep into the mylohyoid, suggesting an ectopic thyroid gland or mucocele likely arising in the deep portion of the submandibular gland (). During the surgical excision, the mass was identified in the surrounding connective tissue of the deep portion of the submandibular gland and was completely excised from the left submandibular gland via an external cervical approach. The gross specimen measured 4×3.5×3 cm and consisted of a unilocular cystic mass that contained grayish brown mucoid material (). The cyst was serially sectioned and entirely embedded for microscopic examination. Microscopic serial sections of the cystic mass demonstrated structures similar to a large bowel loop. The inner cystic space was lined by colonic mucosa with parallel crypts composed of columnar absorptive cells and goblet cells, and lymphoid follicles were sometimes scattered in lamina propria-like stroma (). The cystic surface was composed of colonic mucosa and separated by vague submucosa and muscle layers by the muscularis mucosa (). The submucosal layer showed loosely cohesive collagen bundles and capillary vessels. The muscle layers consisted of bundles of smooth muscles mixed with mature adipose tissue. The distinction of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle bundles was not prominent in the muscle layers. Some parts of the cyst were completely denuded and were composed of inflamed granulation tissue, inflammatory cells and foamy histiocyte aggregate. The cystic wall did not include salivary gland tissue.\nWe characterized the cellular lineage of the cystic lining cells by immunostaining with a colonic lineage marker (CDX-2) and a small intestinal marker (CD10). The antibodies used were CDX-2 (1:100, CDX2-88, Biogenex, San Ramon, CA, USA) and CD10 (1:100, 56C6, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), and the results of the immunohistochemical study are illustrated in . The mucosal epithelia of the present case were positive for CDX-2. However, CD10 was negative in the mucosal epithelium. The final pathologic diagnosis was a heterotopic intestinal cyst occurring in the submandibular gland, and the immunohistochemical results also supported the diagnosis of a heterotopic intestinal lineage. The patient was discharged from the hospital without any complications, and no recurrence was seen during the one-year follow-up period.","{'visit motivation': 'Painless swelling in the left submandibular area', 'admission': [{'reason': 'None', 'date': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'care center details': 'None'}], 'patient information': {'age': '8 years old', 'sex': 'Female', 'ethnicity': 'None', 'weight': 'None', 'height': 'None', 'family medical history': 'Unremarkable', 'recent travels': 'None', 'socio economic context': 'None', 'occupation': 'Student (implied as the patient is an 8-year-old girl)'}, 'patient medical history': {'physiological context': 'No history of local trauma, surgery or infections on the left side of her face or neck', 'psychological context': 'None', 'vaccination history': 'None', 'allergies': 'None', 'exercise frequency': 'None', 'nutrition': 'None', 'sexual history': 'None', 'alcohol consumption': 'None', 'drug usage': 'None', 'smoking status': 'None'}, 'surgeries': [{'reason': 'Excision of a mass in the left submandibular gland', 'Type': 'Surgical excision via an external cervical approach', 'time': 'None', 'outcome': 'Mass was completely excised', 'details': 'Mass identified in the surrounding connective tissue of the deep portion of the submandibular gland'}], 'symptoms': [{'name of symptom': 'Swelling', 'intensity of symptom': 'Painless', 'location': 'Left submandibular area', 'time': 'Over the previous four months', 'temporalisation': 'Progressively enlarging', 'behaviours affecting the symptom': 'None', 'details': 'No swelling in the floor of the mouth, oral mucosa was unremarkable'}], 'medical examinations': [{'name': 'Physical examination', 'result': 'Soft, mobile, well-circumscribed superficial mass 3 cm in diameter', 'details': 'None'}, {'name': 'Computed tomography', 'result': '2.6 cm, cone-shaped, high-density mass with internal microcalcifications', 'details': 'Located in the left submandibular gland along the lateral surfaces of the hyoglossus muscle and genioglossus muscle, extending from the anterior aspect of the submandibular gland deep into the mylohyoid'}], 'diagnosis tests': [{'test': 'Microscopic serial sections', 'severity': 'None', 'result': 'Structures similar to a large bowel loop', 'condition': 'Cystic mass lined by colonic mucosa with parallel crypts composed of columnar absorptive cells and goblet cells, lymphoid follicles in lamina propria-like stroma, colonic mucosa on the cystic surface, vague submucosa and muscle layers separated by the muscularis mucosa, submucosal layer with loosely cohesive collagen bundles and capillary vessels, muscle layers with bundles of smooth muscles mixed with mature adipose tissue', 'time': 'None', 'details': 'The distinction of circular and longitudinal smooth muscle bundles was not prominent in the muscle layers'}], 'treatments': [{'name': 'Surgical excision', 'related condition': 'Cystic mass in the left submandibular gland', 'dosage': 'None', 'time': 'None', 'frequency': 'None', 'duration': 'None', 'reason for taking': 'To remove the mass', 'reaction to treatment': 'None', 'details': 'Gross specimen measured 4×3.5×3 cm, consisted of a unilocular cystic mass that contained grayish brown mucoid material'}], 'discharge': {'reason': 'None', 'referral': 'None', 'follow up': 'None', 'discharge summary': 'None'}}","[['What was the dosage of the medication or treatment?', 'How long did the patient receive the treatment?', 'Are there any additional details mentioned about the treatment (e.g., route of administration, specific instructions)?', 'When was the treatment initiated?', 'What medication or treatment was administered?', 'Why was this treatment initiated?', 'Did the patient experience any side effects or reactions to the treatment?', 'How often was the medication or treatment administered?', 'What specific condition was the treatment intended to address?'], ['Are there any follow-up appointments or instructions for the patient?', 'Why was the patient discharged from the care center?', 'Was the patient referred to any other healthcare providers or specialists?', ""What is a brief summary of the patient's condition and treatment plan at discharge?""]]",Treatments,Discharge,"

3459,"A 46-year-old man also reported exercise/activity-related pain and fatigue from early childhood. As patient 1, he was always considered to be ""a lazy child"". He was not able to run and physical activities such as walking or swimming were challenging. As a child he reported trying to build a good relationship with his physical education teachers, so they would feel pity for him and he could avoid any strenuous physical activities (PA). He experienced three severe episodes of rhabdomyolyses in his life. The first one happened during childhood, which followed vigorous physical activities. The second rhabdomyolysis episode was at the age of 18 following multiple squats, which he performed during a physical test for military service. Not qualifying for the military service, instead he had to complete a civilian service at the university hospital at the age of 22. As he was clearly weaker than his colleagues, a diagnostic investigation took place, which included a skeletal muscle biopsy. At that time, doctors advised him to avoid excessive physical effort. He was told about the second wind phenomenon; however, it was not explained how to reach it. Additionally, he was recommended to eat a maximum of 20% of his daily food intake in carbohydrates. However, the rest of the macronutrients recommendations were not specified. In the following years, his physical activity level decreased, leading to physical deconditioning, loss of muscle mass, and increase in fatty adipose tissue and body weight.\nThe third rhabdomyolysis episode was experienced one year ago and was nearly fatal. He was undergoing physical assessment for the insurance company and pushed himself too hard, resulting in a severe contracture of his lower back muscles. He was admitted to hospital. During the hospital stay he was also diagnosed with myocarditis. Following this episode, he decided to learn more about the condition to manage it better.\nHe began doing gentle aerobic exercises, which improved his ability to attain a second wind. He attended a conference where he met a Spanish team from whom he learnt about the strength training trial performed in Madrid and decided to try it himself in a local gym []. Initially he approached a personal trainer. However, he did not feel the trainer understood his condition and was pushing him too hard. He decided to write his own programme based on strength training principles and exercises he learnt at the conferences and meetings.\nWhen in the gym he reports always doing an aerobic ""warm up"" by cycling on a stationary bike for 20 minutes, he then exercises on resistance machines (chest press, seated row, butterfly, chest horizontal adduction, reversed butterfly, rare deltoids and trapezius, lat pulldown, leg press, leg adductors, and leg abductors).

7945,"We report a rare case of IVC aneurysm in a 22-year old Afghan-Iranian male patient. The patient had a history of blunt abdominal trauma one week prior to his referral to the emergency department of our center.

The investigations were normal and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The patient has had vague abdominal pain after his discharge.\nOn the referral of the patient to our center, we planned an abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast. The scan illustrated an IVC saccular aneurysm originating from right side of the IVC below the renal veins (). We assumed two possible etiologies. The aneurysm could incidentally and in another hand it could be related to the patient's recent history of abdominal trauma. Magnetic resonance venography was also conducted and it also confirmed the diagnosis of a saccular type III IVC aneurysm ().\nWe planned open resection and repair of the aneurysm. A midline laparotomy was done. After thorough exploration of the abdominal and pelvic cavities, a right medial visceral rotation was conducted by mobilization of the right colon and a Kocher maneuver (The Cattel-Braasch Maneuver). The right kidney was left in situ. The entire sub-hepatic IVC was exposed. A saccular aneurysm with dimensions of 4*5 cm was found on exploration (). The aneurysm was located below the renal veins and the neck of the aneurysm was at the right side. The aneurysm was confined to the infrarenal IVC and there was not any associated venous anomaly. Thus, it was a type III saccular IVC aneurysm. A partial Satinsky clamp was applied posterior and left to the site of aneurysm origin on IVC and a longitudinal incision was done anterior to the neck of the aneurysm. Then, the entire aneurysm was resected. The neck of the aneurysm was closed with lateral venorrhaphy by running 6.0 polypropylene sutures ().\nThe patient had well recovery after the operation. Postoperative anticoagulation was administered by unfractionated heparin and warfarin. Warfarin anticoagulation was continued for three months to prevent venous thrombosis and probable pulmonary embolism. The patient's follow-up did not reveal any morbidity. Postoperative CT scan was also conducted on seventh postoperative day.

7199,"A 45-year-old man was admitted for a progressively worsening headache over 2 weeks. He denied history of recent head trauma or anticoagulation and antiplatelet medication. General and neurologic examinations were not remarkable on admission. Routine laboratory investigations including coagulation profiles and platelet function were within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed an isodense CSDH on the right hemisphere with mild midline shift (Fig. a). A CT angiography (CTA) was performed to rule out any intracranial vascular malformation. A DAVF was noticed at the transverse sinus with dilated cortical venous drainage (Fig. b). So, a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the external carotid artery and DAVF embolization was planned.\nNo anomaly was noticed during selective angiography of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries and the left external carotid artery. Selective angiography of the right external carotid artery showed that the DAVF was located at the transverse sinus and fed by posterior branch of the middle meningeal artery (MMA), the occipital artery, and the posterior meningeal artery and drained to the occipital cortical veins with venous ectasia (Fig. a-b). The DAVF was classified as type IV according to the Cognard classification. The embolization was performed via the MMA. The Headway duo catheter was used and accessed to the DAVF, and Onyx was injected until the shunt disappeared (Fig. c-d). The patient experienced an uneventful recovery. His CSDH gradually resolved in 1 month (Fig. ). No neurologic deficit was noticed.\nA PubMed search of published studies written in English and Chinese was conducted on June 30th, 2017. The following key words were used in relevant combinations: dural arteriovenous fistula, dural arteriovenous malformation, subdural hematoma, subdural haematoma, subdural hemorrhage, and subdural haemorrhage. The reference lists of the identified articles were also manually searched for additional studies. Studies of which full text could not be obtained or those without sufficient individualized description of the isolated SDH cases mixed in larger case series were excluded.\nFinally, 13 articles containing 14 patients were identified [–]. In all 15 patients (9 females, 60%) including 1 case in our institution were included for the final interpretation (Table ). The inflicted patients were aged from 27 to 82 years (55.5 ± 8.6).Of note, 12 (80%) of the 15 patients were aged between 40 and 60 years of age, and 8 (53.3%) patients were between 50 and 60 years. Sides of the DAVF or SDH were obtained in 13 patients with 9 (69.2%) located at the left side and 4 at the right side. The intracranial locations of DAVF were anterior fossa (2), middle fossa (2), frontal region (2), parietal region (3), temporal region (2), and occipital region (2). The types of SDH were CSDH (7/15), acute SDH (ASDH) (7/15), and undefined SDH (1/15). Of the 12 patients feeding artery could be identified, MMA was the commonest feeding artery (8/12, 66.7%). Multiple feeding arteries were identified in 3 (25%) patients. The causes of DAVF were only defined in 3 patients (2 iatrogenic and 1 traumatic), with the rest undefined or not mentioned. Cognard classifications (Table ) of the DAVF were reported or deduced from the reports in 12 patients, with type I, type III, and type IV in 7, 2, and 3 patients respectively.

A 45-year-old man was admitted for a progressively worsening headache over 2 weeks. He denied history of recent head trauma or anticoagulation and antiplatelet medication. General and neurologic examinations were not remarkable on admission. Routine laboratory investigations including coagulation profiles and platelet function were within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed an isodense CSDH on the right hemisphere with mild midline shift (Fig. a). A CT angiography (CTA) was performed to rule out any intracranial vascular malformation. A DAVF was noticed at the transverse sinus with dilated cortical venous drainage (Fig. b). So, a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the external carotid artery and DAVF embolization was planned.\nNo anomaly was noticed during selective angiography of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries and the left external carotid artery. Selective angiography of the right external carotid artery showed that the DAVF was located at the transverse sinus and fed by posterior branch of the middle meningeal artery (MMA), the occipital artery, and the posterior meningeal artery and drained to the occipital cortical veins with venous ectasia (Fig. a-b). The DAVF was classified as type IV according to the Cognard classification. The embolization was performed via the MMA. The Headway duo catheter was used and accessed to the DAVF, and Onyx was injected until the shunt disappeared (Fig. c-d). The patient experienced an uneventful recovery. His CSDH gradually resolved in 1 month (Fig. ). No neurologic deficit was noticed.\nA PubMed search of published studies written in English and Chinese was conducted on June 30th, 2017. The following key words were used in relevant combinations: dural arteriovenous fistula, dural arteriovenous malformation, subdural hematoma, subdural haematoma, subdural hemorrhage, and subdural haemorrhage. The reference lists of the identified articles were also manually searched for additional studies. Studies of which full text could not be obtained or those without sufficient individualized description of the isolated SDH cases mixed in larger case series were excluded.\nFinally, 13 articles containing 14 patients were identified [–]. In all 15 patients (9 females, 60%) including 1 case in our institution were included for the final interpretation (Table ). The inflicted patients were aged from 27 to 82 years (55.5 ± 8.6).Of note, 12 (80%) of the 15 patients were aged between 40 and 60 years of age, and 8 (53.3%) patients were between 50 and 60 years. Sides of the DAVF or SDH were obtained in 13 patients with 9 (69.2%) located at the left side and 4 at the right side. The intracranial locations of DAVF were anterior fossa (2), middle fossa (2), frontal region (2), parietal region (3), temporal region (2), and occipital region (2). The types of SDH were CSDH (7/15), acute SDH (ASDH) (7/15), and undefined SDH (1/15). Of the 12 patients feeding artery could be identified, MMA was the commonest feeding artery (8/12, 66.7%). Multiple feeding arteries were identified in 3 (25%) patients. The causes of DAVF were only defined in 3 patients (2 iatrogenic and 1 traumatic), with the rest undefined or not mentioned. Cognard classifications (Table ) of the DAVF were reported or deduced from the reports in 12 patients, with type I, type III, and type IV in 7, 2, and 3 patients respectively. The treatment strategies included hematoma evacuation (2/15), CSDH drainage and DAVF embolization (5/15), craniotomy and DAVF resection (3/15), DAVF embolization and hematoma evacuation (1/15), DAVF embolization (2/15), and not applicable or not mentioned (2/15). Of the 12 patients with direct description of outcome, 7 (58.3%) patients were neurological intact, 3 (25%) patients with neurological deficits, and 2 (16.7%) died.

25724,"A 26-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 0) at 24 weeks of pregnancy with placenta previa was referred to our hospital for intrauterine fetal death in March 2019. MRI on March 15, 2019 showed that the lower edge of the placenta completely covered the cervical os, with no obvious infiltration of placenta in uterine wall or cervix. The estimated thickness of the placenta at the os was 3 centimeters. After an intra amniotic injection of 100 mg ethacridine lactate solution, 50 mg mifepristone was administered orally once every 12 hours 3 times. At 18:45 on March 16, uterine contractions were normal at 3-min intervals and lasting for 25 seconds. The cervix opening was dilated to 1.5 cm. The total volume of intermittent vaginal bleeding was 200 mL (by weight) in 40 minutes. The patient's hemoglobin level was 127 g/L. Under the ultrasound guidance, a cervical ripening balloon was inserted through the placenta and placed between the fetus and the placenta using toothless oval forceps. Saline (150 mL) was injected into the cervical ripening balloon. At the time of cervix expansion, an external traction force was applied to the balloon; vaginal bleeding was immediately reduced due to the cervical ripening balloon compressing against the placenta. At 21:09, when the cervical ripening balloon was slipped out of the vagina, the cervix opening was dilated to 3 cm, with fetal presentation at S-1 cm (the lowest point of fetal skull is 1 cm above the ischial spine plane) and fetal head close to the cervix; contractions were normal. Six minutes later, the fetus was delivered via the vagina; there was total 50 mL of bleeding during the delivery. Placenta and fetal membranes were naturally delivered afterward without placental defect. The total time from the balloon placement to the end of the delivery was 2 hours and 30 minutes. The patient recovered in the hospital for 3 days with no complications. The hypersensitive C-reactive protein level was 22.2 mg/L and the hemoglobin level was 115 g/L post-delivery.

167604,"A 38-year-old North African man, with no past medical history, consulted our out-patient clinic for a painless left scrotal mass. There was no history of previous orchitis or scrotal contusion. He noted the mass a month ago. A physical examination found a 2 cm palpable mass in the upper pole of his left testis. There were no signs of scrotal inflammation. The mass had a firm consistency and regular margins. Palpation of his right testis and the lower pole of his left testis were normal. Routine blood tests were normal. As a testicular tumor was strongly suspected, a bioassay of testicular tumor markers was ordered. Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were in the normal ranges. There was no bacterial growth in urine analysis, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis screening. A scrotal ultrasound showed a homogeneous testicular parenchyma, with a conserved vascularization on Doppler. An extratesticular mass was observed, attached to the upper pole of his testis. The mass was isoechoic to the testis parenchyma, and poorly vascularized Doppler (Fig. ).\nHe underwent a radical inguinal orchiectomy. We first performed a high ligation of the spermatic cord. The operative specimen included the testis and the tunica vaginalis in one piece (Fig. ). The macroscopic aspect of the supratesticular mass looks similar to splenic tissue (Fig. ). There were no macroscopic lesions of the testis and the spermatic cord. His postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged on the second postoperative day.\nHistological examination of the operative specimen confirmed the presence of regular splenic tissue in the suspect mass, without any signs of malignancy.

A 38-year-old North African man, with no past medical history, consulted our out-patient clinic for a painless left scrotal mass. There was no history of previous orchitis or scrotal contusion. He noted the mass a month ago. A physical examination found a 2 cm palpable mass in the upper pole of his left testis. There were no signs of scrotal inflammation. The mass had a firm consistency and regular margins. Palpation of his right testis and the lower pole of his left testis were normal. Routine blood tests were normal. As a testicular tumor was strongly suspected, a bioassay of testicular tumor markers was ordered. Alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were in the normal ranges. There was no bacterial growth in urine analysis, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis screening. A scrotal ultrasound showed a homogeneous testicular parenchyma, with a conserved vascularization on Doppler. An extratesticular mass was observed, attached to the upper pole of his testis. The mass was isoechoic to the testis parenchyma, and poorly vascularized Doppler (Fig. ).\nHe underwent a radical inguinal orchiectomy. We first performed a high ligation of the spermatic cord. The operative specimen included the testis and the tunica vaginalis in one piece (Fig. ). The macroscopic aspect of the supratesticular mass looks similar to splenic tissue (Fig. ). There were no macroscopic lesions of the testis and the spermatic cord. His postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged on the second postoperative day.\nHistological examination of the operative specimen confirmed the presence of regular splenic tissue in the suspect mass, without any signs of malignancy. The splenic proliferation had its proper and regular capsule, demarcating it from the testis. Testicular pulp, the albuginea and the tunica vaginalis had a preserved microscopic architecture (Fig. ). He was examined 3 weeks after orchiectomy and he was examined again 2 months after the orchiectomy in our out-patient unit. An abdominal ultrasound showed an habitual location with standard measurements and a regular aspect of his spleen.

101821,"Mrs. S is a 56-year-old lady who was brought to our hospital with history of alleged snake bite. Patient had been working in the fields when she was bitten by a snake. Patient was not able to identify the snake. She had informed her daughter-in-law who took her to a traditional medical practitioner. The practitioner had taken some leaves from a plant in his garden; he then crushed it and applied the crushed leaves to the bite site. The milky fluid which was obtained from crushing the leaves was given to the patient to drink by the healer. The patient on questioning later remembered that the fluid caused severe burning and irritation in the throat. After taking the medication the patient was taken home. At home the patient progressively worsened and became drowsy, so the relatives decided to take her to the District hospital a few kilometers away.\nAt the district hospital the doctors on arrival noticed that she was hypotensive and her blood pressure was not recordable. She was immediately intubated ventilated with ambu bag with oxygen initiated on ionotropes and referred to a tertiary care center for further management.\nPatient was brought to our accident and emergency department, at this time her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, heart rate: 112/min, cardiovascular system there were normal heart sounds and no murmurs or gallop, respiratory system there were bibasal crackles up to the angle of scapula. Central nervous system the Glasgow coma scale was 2T/15, pupils were equal and reacting to light, dolls eye movement was present, deep tendon reflexes were present the plantars were mute. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and ionotropes were continued. Local examination revealed fang marks over the dorsum of the right hand.\nThe patient was admitted and investigations revealed that her sugars were high at admission [] and potassium was slightly low otherwise all investigations were normal. But her echocardiogram done after admission into the medical intensive care unit showed global hypokinesia with a low ejection fraction 30%.\nAt this point the diagnosis we considered was that of cardiogenic shock due to plant toxin with cardiotoxicity, secondary ton antidote for the snake bite given by the traditional practitioner. We requested the patient's relatives to bring the plant, this was identified as calotropis.

92360,"A 24 year old man presented with on and off fever and diffuse abdominal pain since one week. He also had constipation, vomiting and abdominal distention since two days.\nHe was apparently normal a week ago when he developed abdominal pain for which he visited a peripheral hospital. An Ultrasonography (USG) abdomen was done, which revealed the possibility of a mild appendicular inflammation. He was treated with oral antibiotics and analgesics following which his abdominal pain subsided. Few days later he developed abdominal distention and vomiting.\nOn examination he was afebrile and vitals were stable. Abdomen was soft, distended and non tender. Free fluid was present in peritoneal cavity and bowel sounds were absent. Routine blood investigations were normal except for leucocytosis of 30,400 with neutrophilia. Plain X-ray of abdomen showed dilated jejunal and ileal loops with multiple air-fluid levels. Paracentesis yielded hemorrhagic ascetic fluid. USG abdomen revealed gross ascites and thickened bowel wall with absent peristalsis. Contrast enhanced CT abdomen showed small bowel obstruction and massive ascites.\nMeanwhile patient was kept nil per oral with nasogastric aspiration. He was started on prophylactic intravenous antibiotics and analgesics. On reassessment patient's condition remained unaltered. A diagnosis of mechanical intestinal obstruction of unknown etiology was made and he was scheduled for emergency laparotomy.\nAbdomen was opened with a midline vertical incision. Three litres of hemorrhagic fluid was drained. Dilated jejunal loops were seen. These loops were traced up to a segment of ischemic ileum. The ileal segment was strangulated by a band composed of inflamed appendix and omentum (Fig &). The band was running from caecum to ileum producing a window underneath.

A 24 year old man presented with on and off fever and diffuse abdominal pain since one week. He also had constipation, vomiting and abdominal distention since two days.\nHe was apparently normal a week ago when he developed abdominal pain for which he visited a peripheral hospital. An Ultrasonography (USG) abdomen was done, which revealed the possibility of a mild appendicular inflammation. He was treated with oral antibiotics and analgesics following which his abdominal pain subsided. Few days later he developed abdominal distention and vomiting.\nOn examination he was afebrile and vitals were stable. Abdomen was soft, distended and non tender. Free fluid was present in peritoneal cavity and bowel sounds were absent. Routine blood investigations were normal except for leucocytosis of 30,400 with neutrophilia. Plain X-ray of abdomen showed dilated jejunal and ileal loops with multiple air-fluid levels. Paracentesis yielded hemorrhagic ascetic fluid. USG abdomen revealed gross ascites and thickened bowel wall with absent peristalsis. Contrast enhanced CT abdomen showed small bowel obstruction and massive ascites.\nMeanwhile patient was kept nil per oral with nasogastric aspiration. He was started on prophylactic intravenous antibiotics and analgesics. On reassessment patient's condition remained unaltered. A diagnosis of mechanical intestinal obstruction of unknown etiology was made and he was scheduled for emergency laparotomy.\nAbdomen was opened with a midline vertical incision. Three litres of hemorrhagic fluid was drained. Dilated jejunal loops were seen. These loops were traced up to a segment of ischemic ileum. The ileal segment was strangulated by a band composed of inflamed appendix and omentum (Fig &). The band was running from caecum to ileum producing a window underneath. Through this window the intestine had protruded (Fig ).\nThe attachment of the band was released from the ileum and omentum, following which appendicectomy was done. The bowel was found viable and hence no resection was needed. Post op period was uneventful and patient was discharged on 7th day. Histopathology report confirmed acute appendicitis. On three month follow up he is doing well.
